<p>Researching Stephen Carpenter has been difficult.&nbsp; He seemed to marry a
lot of women and have a lot of children, but there aren't very many divorce or death
records available to help make sense of these various relationships.&nbsp; I
need to thank Ted Carpenter and Iva Baker among others for their extensive work
on the Carpenter family.&nbsp; According to Iva Baker of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Stephen Carpenter was born about 1803 in Hawkins County,
Tennessee and was the son of Fielding Carpenter and his
wife Delphia.&nbsp; Stephen married or had significant relationships with at
least six women.&nbsp; A record of what is most likely his first marriage is recorded in the <i>Annals
of Floyd County, Kentucky</i>, p. 270:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Bond dated 2 April 1822 by Stephen Carpender and Hiram Prewitt for a
  marriage shortly to be had between Stephen Carpender and Nancy Walker.</p>
  <p>This is to surtify that Felden Carpender and his wife is consentable for
  his son Stephen Carpender to give in matramony with Nancy Walker.</p>
  <p>30 March 1822, This is to certify that Jacob Coburn is willing for Stephen
  Carpenter to have his daughter Nancy.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nancy Walker was the daughter of Betty Walker who married Jacob Coburn on the
18th of April 1816, in Floyd County.&nbsp; Jacob Coburn would have been Nancy's stepfather at the time of
her marriage to Stephen Carpenter.&nbsp; I don't know anything about Betty Walker, I assume&nbsp;she
had previously been married to a Walker, but it is possible that Walker was her
maiden name.&nbsp; On the 1830 census of Floyd County, Stephen was listed as a
male between 20 and 30 and Nancy was listed as a female between 20 and 30.&nbsp; The
household also included a daughter between the age of 5 and 10 and three sons under 5.&nbsp;
Nancy most likely died sometime after the 1830 census was taken.</p>
<p> Stephen married a second time in 1833 to Sally Gabbard in Estill County:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is to certify that on the 23rd of this month, I joined together in the
Holy state of Marriage, Stephen Carpenter and Sally Gabbard.&nbsp; In witness
whereof, I hereunto set my hand.&nbsp; --Abraham Thomas, 24 January 1833.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bondsmen for the marriage were Stephen Carpenter and Edward Gabbard.</p>
<p>I haven't found Stephen Carpenter on the 1840 census in Kentucky.&nbsp; But
on 7 March 1838 he bought 40 acres in Laurel County from William and Rachel
Sears, for $40.00.&nbsp; I don't know if Sally Gabbard died or she and Stephen
were divorced, but their children, Emiline, William, Amanda and John C. appear
on the 1850 census of Rockcastle County with Stephen Carpenter and Nancy, age 36.&nbsp; This
was most likely
Nancy Howard of Breathitt County .&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't found a marriage record for them, but their first
child was born about 1844.&nbsp; Their son Stephen Paul Carpenter applied for
funds appropriated by the Act of Congress in favor of the Eastern Cherokees in
1907.&nbsp; Stephen P. claimed that his great grandfather Thomas Howard had married
a Cherokee Indian.&nbsp; Stephen's claim was rejected.&nbsp; On the application he
listed his father as Stephen Carpenter and his mother as Nancy Howard.&nbsp; He
listed his paternal grandparents as Fielding and Delpha Carpenter.&nbsp; I
haven't found a divorce for Stephen Carpenter and Nancy Howard, since Stephen
married again in 1852, I assume they were divorced or they were never legally
married.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephen
Carpenter married Amanda Lakes Brock, (listed as a widow), on 18 November 1852.&nbsp;
The marriage was recorded in both Rockcastle and Laurel counties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rockcastle County - 18 November 1852:&nbsp; Stephen Carpenter of Rockcastle
County, 45 years, widower, to Mandy Lax, Rockcastle County, 32 years, widow,
place of birth, Madison County, Kentucky.</p>
<p>Laurel County - 18 November 1852:&nbsp; Stephen Carpenter of Rockcastle
County, age 50, widower, born Hawkins Co., Tenn. married Manda Brock of
Rockcastle County, age 32, widow, born Madison County. Kentucky</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stephen was listed as a widower on both of these records.&nbsp;&nbsp;His
first wife, Nancy Walker was most likely deceased and his second wife, Sally Gabbard
was most likely deceased as well.&nbsp; However
Nancy Howard was very much alive in 1852, and appeared on the 1860 census of
Jackson County as Nancy Howard.&nbsp;I haven't found Nancy Howard Carpenter on the 1870 census,
but she appeared on the 1880 census of Breathitt County.&nbsp; Sometime before
1880 Nancy married John McDaniel, and the two of them are living in the
household of Nancy's daughter Polly Jenkins.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Stephen and Amanda had three children before Amanda filed for divorce in
1859.&nbsp; The divorce records of Amanda and Stephen Carpenter can be found in the Jackson
County Circuit Court records:
</p>
<p>November
term, 1859, 3rd day
</p>
<p>p. 77 Amanda Carpenter, Plaintiff against Stephen Carpenter, Defendant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This day this cause was heard and the court advised adjudges that the plaintiff
Amanda Carpenter be and she is hereby divorced from the defendant Stephen
Carpenter and is hereby restated to all the rights and privileges of an
unmarried woman and the defendant Stephen Carpenter is hereby restored to all
the rights and privileges of an unmarried man after the expiration of one year
from this date and it is further ordered that the plaintiff recover of the
defendant the cost in this cause and it is stricken from the docket.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During
the same November term, 1859, but on the 5th day, Stephen Carpenter was indicted
for adultery and his bail was set at $50.00.&nbsp; This case came to court one
year later during the November term, 1860, 2nd day, p. 156:
</p>
<p><font size="3">November Term, 1860, 2<sup>nd</sup> day, p.156 --
Commonwealth, plaintiff against Stephen Carpenter – adultery</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">This day came the attorney and the defendant pleads not
  guilty and there upon came a jury to wit: ........who being elected tried and
  sworn to try the issue returned into court the following verdict, &quot;We of
  the jury find the defendant not guilty of the within. J.H. Durham foreman and
  the defendant to go hence without delay.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Laura Altevers, who has a very good Lakes Web Page at&nbsp; <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/c/h/Laura-K-Schultz/index.html">http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/c/h/Laura-K-Schultz/index.html</a>&nbsp;
Amanda Lakes was something of an enigma. Laura Altevers states:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda Lakes was the daughter of&nbsp;John and Mary (Abrams) Lakes.   John
Lakes was born 1795/1796&nbsp;in NC and died 10 June 1859 in Jackson County.  He was buried under a cliff&nbsp;near the Lewis Lakes Cemetery in Jackson County.  Mary was born
about 1792 in&nbsp;PA and died sometime after 1870.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There is something of a mystery about Amanda's relationships.  Prior to 1849,&nbsp;Amanda may have been married to or had a relationship with an unknown Brock,&nbsp;as she had possibly three children by
him according to the 1860 Jackson County census.  She was listed as Amanda Lakes on the 1860
census.&nbsp; She was also listed as&nbsp;Amanda Lakes on the 1860 land grant.
However on the 1870 census, she
was listed as
Amanda Carpenter, with no husband in the household.&nbsp;

<p>On the 1860 census of Jackson County Stephen
Carpenter was living with several of his children. Nancy Howard and
Amanda Lakes were both living in Jackson County as well, but in separate
households. &nbsp;Nancy's older children were living with their father, but her
youngest, Stephen Paul was living with her.&nbsp; Amanda's children were all
living with her.&nbsp; In addition to Nancy's older children, Stephen also had
Sally Gabbard's youngest child, John C. living with him, (presumably Sally's
older children were on their own by this time),&nbsp; and also a two year old
Stephen Duncan Carpenter, whose mother is unknown.&nbsp; There is more discussion
of these children below.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In 1870, Stephen Carpenter was living in Breathitt County with
Rebecca Davis. Although she was listed as Rebecca Carpenter on the census, I haven't found a copy of
a marriage certificate.&nbsp; Rebecca's mother, Elizabeth Proffitt Davis, was also living with Stephen and
Rebecca, however she was mistakenly listed on the census as Elizabeth Carpenter.&nbsp; Rebecca was the
daughter of John Evan Davis and Elizabeth Proffitt.&nbsp; Rebecca was also the
sister in law of Stephen Carpenter since her brother William Davis had married Sarah
Carpenter, Stephen's sister.&nbsp; Stephen's son Stephen (age 12)&nbsp; and
Manervy Carpenter age (19) were also enumerated with Stephen and Rebecca on the
1870 census.&nbsp; I am not sure who Minervy Carpenter was but she might have
been the daughter of Stephen's brother Samuel Carpenter and his wife Katherine
Allen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Amanda Lakes Brock Carpenter was living in
Jackson County in 1870 with her daughter Marinda Brock (listed Carpenter), and
her three children with Stephen Carpenter.&nbsp; I haven't been able to find
Nancy Howard Carpenter on the 1870 census.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In
1880 Stephen was living in Menifee County and listed as Caleb Carpenter on the
census.&nbsp; He was 77 years old and living with a woman named Nancy and his
son Stephen who was born in 1858.&nbsp; Stephen Caleb Carpenter left a will in Menifee County that was probated
in 1884.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Know
all men by these presents that I Stephen Carpenter in the county of Menifee and
State of Kentucky considering the uncertainty of this life and being of sound
mind and memory do make , declare and publish this my last will and testament -

<p>John

</p>
<p>Benjamin
Back
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benjamin
Back was listed next door to Stephen Carpenter on the 1880 census.&nbsp; I have
been told&nbsp; by David Schimka, <a href="mailto:david@schimka.com">david@schimka.com</a>&nbsp;
a descendant of Benjamin Back's, that John
Wells was most likely Benjamin Back's father in law.&nbsp; I assume that
Benjamin Back and John Wells witnessed the will because they were
neighbors.&nbsp; At this point I have not found any other relationship they
might have had with Stephen Carpenter.&nbsp; I don't have any additional
information about this Nancy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In
1880, Amanda Lakes Brock Carpenter was living in Rockcastle County with her
daughter Marinda and her grandchildren.&nbsp; Nancy Howard Carpenter was living
in Breathitt County with her daughter Polly Jenkins (Junkims on the census), and
Nancy's new husband John McDaniel.&nbsp; Nancy married John McDaniel in about
1878.&nbsp; Polly/Mary was a daughter Nancy had after her relationship with
Stephen Carpenter.

Carpenter and Jane Carpenter were siblings, Sylvester and Hannah were first
cousins. Sylvester

father and Nancy Howard in Rockcastle County in 1850.&nbsp; She married Job Morris 19
March 1860 (bond), in Jackson County.&nbsp; Job Morris filed for a divorce
during the October term of of the Jackson County Court, 1874,&nbsp; p. 146.&nbsp;The divorce was granted on the 7th of October 1875, and listed in the Circuit

</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Job Morris married Mary Lakes, daughter of John Lakes sometime after
he divorced Emiline.&nbsp; Job and Mary Lakes were listed on the 1880 census of
Jackson County with four children, the older two being Joel 8, and William
6.&nbsp; I am not sure if these two older children were the sons of Emiline
Carpenter Morris or Mary Lakes Morris.&nbsp; Emiline Carpenter was listed on the
1880 census with her son Lewis, 14.&nbsp; Job Morris and Mary Lakes Morris were
divorced on 7 October 1891 in Jackson County.
</p>
<p>In 1874 Job Morris and James R. Isaacs each had to sign a peace bond (Jackson
County Circuit Court Order Bk. 3), agreeing&nbsp; not to comment an offense
against each other.&nbsp; I am not sure what the nature of their difficulties
were.</p>

William P. Carpenter </b> was born about 1839.&nbsp; He married Allie Stevens on 28
December 1862 in Jackson County.&nbsp;&nbsp; Allie was the daughter of Solomon
Stephens and Margaret Seaborn. William Carpenter was a Sgt in Co. E., 47th KY
Infantry.&nbsp; He was listed in Madison County, Arkansas
in the 1870 and 1880 censuses and in Franklin County, Arkansas in the 1900 census.
On the 1900 census Allie listed that she was the mother of 15 children and 14 of

of Stephen Carpenter and Amanda Lake&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>1.
Susan L. Carpenter </b> was born 4 June 1853, in Rockcastle County.&nbsp; The
birth was recorded in the vital records of Rockcastle County, &quot;L. S.
Carpenter (female) was born to Stephen Carpenter and Manda Lax in May 1853,
parents live in Laurel.&quot;&nbsp; The March term, 1871 Jackson County Circuit
Court records listed a&nbsp; bastardy bond against Elisha Harrison for a child of
Suzin Carpenter's --&nbsp;&nbsp; Elisha Harrison had to pay $30.00 immediately,
$10 one
month from the date and $10.00 per year for 2 years.&nbsp; The child is never
named, but Sophia Carpenter, age 1 is living with Amanda Carpenter, her
daughters Miranda (Brock) and Susan, as well as Amanda's two sons, Doctor John
Thomas and Andrew John in 1870.&nbsp; However, in 1880, Sophia 10, John C. 8,
Thomas J. 4 and Matt H. 2 are all listed as grandchildren living with
Amanda.&nbsp; Amanda's daughter Marinda who is listed as Miranda Brock on the
1860 census was also living in the household but her daughter Susan wasn't
living with them.&nbsp; Sophia could be the child of either daughter. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>2.
Doctor John Thomas Carpenter</b> was born 6 April 1854 in Rockcastle County.&nbsp; He married
Mary Louisa Noble 6 April 1874 in Breathitt County.&nbsp; In 1880 Louisa
Carpenter was listed in Breathitt County, p. 649C, with sons John Carpenter 1
and Thomas Carpenter 8 months.&nbsp; J. T. Carpenter 24, was listed in Jackson
County living with Elizabeth Lamb and Caldona Lamb 3 months old.&nbsp; Elizabeth
was listed as a servant, and no relationship was given for Caldona.&nbsp; During
the September term 1881, Jackson County Court charged Doc Carpenter with
adultery.&nbsp; Doctor J. T. and Elizabeth/Betty Carpenter appear on the 1900,
1910 and 1920 censuses.&nbsp; Doctor J. T. died in about 1941 and is buried at
Three Links, Jackson County Kentucky.&nbsp; The tombstone reads D.J. and Betty
Carpenter. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>3.
Andrew John Carpenter</b> was born 28 March 1857 in Laurel County.&nbsp; His
birth was recorded in the vital records of Laurel County, &quot;Andrew J.
Carpenter born 28 March 1857 in Laurel County to Stephen Carpenter and Amanda
Lax.&nbsp; Parents live in Laurel.&quot;&nbsp; Andrew
married Molly Phillips. </p>

<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center"><b><font size="4">Stephen
Carpenter's other children and marriages</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>1.&nbsp;
Mary/Polly Howard</b> was born about 1856.&nbsp; She was listed in the 1860 household of
Nancy Howard along with Nancy's son Stephen who was 8.&nbsp; Both children were
listed with the surname Howard.&nbsp; Stephen listed Mary as his sister on his
Eastern Cherokee application.&nbsp; He listed Mary as Mary Jenkins who had died in 1902 or 1903.&nbsp; I am sure Mary was the daughter of Nancy
Howard, but I don't think Stephen Carpenter was her father.&nbsp; Stephen
Carpenter was married to Amanda Lake Brock in 1856 the year Mary Howard was
born.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 1880 census, Mary Howard was listed as Polly Jenkins,
and she listed her father as having been born in Ireland.&nbsp; She was also
listed as &quot;single&quot; rather than as divorced or widowed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>2.
Stephen Duncan Carpenter</b> appeared as a two year old on the 1860 census with his
father Stephen Carpenter. Some people assume that he was a child of Stephen Carpenter
and Amanda Lakes, since he was born during the time Stephen and Amanda were
legally married.&nbsp; But on the 1860 census, Amanda's children were living
with her rather than Stephen.&nbsp;
It doesn't seem logical that she would keep the 7, 5 and 4 year old, but have
the 2 year old stay with his father.&nbsp;This Stephen Duncan/ or Stephen W.
(see below) might have been partly responsible for the adultery charges that
were brought against Stephen in November 1859, although he was found not guilty
a year later. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>3.
Stephen W. Carpenter</b> was born in March, 1858.&nbsp; He married
Margaret McIntosh. He was most likely the same person as&nbsp; Stephen Duncan Carpenter who appeared as a two
year old on the 1860
census with Stephen Carpenter.&nbsp; According to Ted Carpenter,
&quot;Duncan&quot; was a surname.&nbsp; He explained the Stephen Duncan/Stephen
W. problem this way </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>About
  1861-1862,&nbsp; Stephen Caleb moved his family back to Breathitt
  County.&nbsp; Nancy Howard and her children, including Stephen Paul Carpenter
  were also there.&nbsp; With a Stephen Paul, born 10 March 1852 and a Stephen
  Duncan, born May 1858 in the same county, people started calling Stephen Paul
  &quot;Black Steve&quot; because he had a dark complexion and Stephen Duncan
  &quot;White Steve&quot; because of his fair complexion.&nbsp; Stephen Duncan
  changed his middle initial to &quot;W.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Stephen
W. was the only child specifically named in
his father's will.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<div>
</div>
<p>It
doesn't seem that Stephen Carpenter had additional children with his last two wives.&nbsp;
The family lore is that he was married seven times and had 48 children.&nbsp;
Although I imagine those numbers are exaggerated, it is certainly possible that
I have missed a wife and a child or two. </p>
