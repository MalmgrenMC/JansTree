<p>In
instances where I have additional information on a particular family appearing
in the census, I have attached a link to a biographical sketch.&nbsp; However,
as the number of sketches increased I realized that it often became difficult to locate
a specific sketch in the body of the census; so I have made a separate link to
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
