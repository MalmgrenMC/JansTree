<p><b><font size="5">Godfrey Isaacs Sr.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Godfrey
Isaacs was born sometime between 1738 and 1748 in Virginia.&nbsp; He was the son of Samuel Isaacs whose will was probated in 1760 in Frederick County,
Virginia.&nbsp; What little is known about Godfrey Isaacs has been pieced
together with the help of a few records in which he is mentioned.&nbsp; We know he
had a wife named Sarah, and that he was the father of <a href="LinkSamuelNancy.htm"> Samuel Isaacs</a> (born about
1773 in North Carolina),&nbsp; who married Nancy Baldridge, and <a href="LinkGodfreyBetsy.htm"> Godfrey Isaacs</a> (born about
1775 in North Carolina),
who married Elizabeth Howard.&nbsp; We know the family moved from Northa
Carolina to Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Samuel and Godfrey subsequently moved from
Virginia to Kentucky in the early 1800's.&nbsp; Godfrey
Sr. was most likely also the father of Fielding
Ashby Isaacs who stayed in Virginia.&nbsp; The 1767 lease transcribed below between Godfrey
Isaacs Sr. and David Ashby provides more information.&nbsp; This
record and Fielding Isaacs' middle name has lead to the speculation that
Godfrey Isaacs' wife Sarah was an Ashby, although no definitive proof has been
found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Godfrey's father Samuel Isaacs, Jr. (b.? - d. ca.1760) and grandfather Samuel Isaacs,
(b.? - d. ca. 1750) appeared in the earliest tax, court and
land records of Frederick County, VA.  Frederick County was formed from Orange County in 1743.  An
earlier record, 1737, of Samuel Isaacs (Sr.?)&nbsp; appeared in the Orange County, Virginia
Court Book 1, p. 237.<br>
<br>
Both Samuel (Sr.?) and Samuel, Jr. appeared on Col. James Woods' 1744 Fee Book for&nbsp;
Frederick County, VA. Samuel (Sr.?) was assessed (taxed) 51 pounds of tobacco and Samuel, Jr. was assessed 120 pounds.
Elisha Isaacs was assessed 126 pounds. This was most likely Samuel, Jr.'s brother Elisha/Elijah.<br>
<br>
The very first trial in Frederick County (February 1744) was a case against someone
named Dooues for assault and battery on one Samuel Isaacs.  Samuel Isaacs also served on jury
duty of the new
court (April 1744).<br>
<br>
Samuel Isaacs purchased a 200 acre surveyed tract from a Mr. Guilder ca. 1740/1742.
Samuel Isaacs Sr.'s will was dated 4 December 1749 and proven 8 May 1750.  Samuel
Isaacs Jr.
had land surveyed by George William Fairfax and George Washington on 22 October 1750.  He received
a Fairfax grant (patent) for a total of 415 acres on 8 August 1752.  This was the land
Samuel Jr.
willed to his sons Elisha/Elijah and Godfrey.</p>

<p>We know Godfrey Isaacs Sr. served in the
Revolutionary War because he was mentioned in a declaration given by Matthew
Sparks.&nbsp; There are records of the service of&nbsp; Godfrey's older brother Col. Elijah Isaacs (who was  captured at the
battle of Camden, SC in August  1780), as well as records of the service of Elijah's  son
Samuel Isaacs who received a pension in Tennessee in  the 1800's.&nbsp; But the
only known record of Godfrey's service is found in the Matthew Sparks
declaration. Godfrey Sr. is
believed to have died in Wilkes Co., North Carolina before the state census of 1787.</p>

<p>Larry
Robinson of Columbia South Carolina was kind enough to copy the Revolutionary War record
of Matthew Sparks at the National Archives, and Barry Isaacs was kind enough to
transcribe it.&nbsp; Barry transcribed the record exactly as written, with
punctuation and capitalization (or the lack thereof) as found in the
original.&nbsp; There were no paragraph breaks except for the final sentence,
but I have taken the liberty of adding a couple.&nbsp;</p>

  Declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the Act of Congress passed June 7th 1832.<br>
  State of Tennessee<br>
  Carroll County</p>
<p><br>
  On the 14th day of September A.D. 1832. personally appeared in open court, before the  worshipful Henry Wright, Wilson Lightfoot &amp; Saml Ingram Justices of the Court of
pleas and  quarter sessions now sitting Matthew Sparks a resident of said county, and
State, aged about  seventy four years, who being first duly sworn, according to Law,
doth on his oath, make the  following declaration, in order to obtain the benefit of an act
of Congress passed June 7, 1832,  states that he was born, in Rowan County near Salisbury in the State of North Carolina, on the  20th day of January A.D. 1759.  and
there lived with his father until he was between fourteen  and sixteen years old, when he
removed, With the other members of the family to New River in  Wilkes County in the
State aforesaid, and there this declarant resided until three of four years  after the close
of the Revolutionary War, at which time this declarant removed to Wilkes  County in
the State of Georgia, after residing in this latter place about two years, this declarant  removed to the frontier part of the State last mentioned in what as well as this declarant
now  recollects was then Franklin County, here this declarant with his father and other
settlers  erected a fort which was then and probably still is called Sparks Fort.  In this&nbsp;
neighborhood this  declarant's father was killed by the Indians.  after residing at this place two or three years this  declarant removed to Granville District in the State of
South Carolina, where he resided seven  or eight years, when he removed to Jackson
county in the State of Georgia, here this declarant  resided 6. or 7. years, when he
removed to Livingston County in the State of Kentucky about  the  year 1807. or 1808.
where he resided about two years, from thence again removed into the  Territory of
Illinois, and the County of St. Clair about the year 1810.  He here settled on Silver  Creek within 8, or 10 miles of the town Belleville and remained 5. years.  He then
removed  down on a creek called Muddy, in said Territory, where he resided 2. years;
About the year  1817. declarant states, he again removed over into Arkansas Territory,&nbsp;
where he settled on  White River and remained about 2. years; from thence he went to
Arkansas River about 40, or  50 miles above Little Rock, the aforesaid Territory,
where he lived 2. years;  Then removed  from there to the Saline on the waters of
Ouachita within 25 miles of Little Rock, where he again  settled, and resided until the
2nd day of August, Last, when he removed into this County.</p>
<p>This  declarant states that
he entered the service of the United States and served as herein stated.  When the
declarant was 17. or 18. years old, as well as he can recollect in the year "1776' or  "77. he joined a company raised by drafting.  commanded by Captain John Beverly,
and  served a tour of 3. months.  We marched from Wilkes County, North Carolina where the  company was raised and ranged through the lower and sandy part of North
Carolina in search  of the Tories, to intimidate and keep them down in that part of the
State.  On this tour, we found  no parties of Tories embodied, but we took several
individuals, I remember particularly that we  took a Tory Captain by the name of&nbsp;
Jackson [by trade?] blacksmith whom we hung; our  company took two others, names
not recollected and sent them to Head Quarters of the corps.  The Company of which I
was a member were mounted Rangers.  The corps to which I  belonged consisted of several companies of Rangers, and two or, three of foot and was  commanded by Col
[Elijah/Elisha] Isaacks.  given name not recollected of North Carolina  I do  not remember
any Major or Adjutant, nor the name of any other Captains except Captain  Isbel who
commanded as well as I recollect a company of the foot men.  At the end of our term  of
service we were marched back to our county by our Officers, and there dismissed to
go to  our respective homes, without receiving any written discharge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  In the fall of a
certain year I do  not recollect what year,  Nor do I remember how long after my return
from my first tour, but not  more than on [sic] or two years, I was again drafted into the
service, in a company commanded  by Captain Samuel Johnson, and Elisha Reynolds Lieutenant, this corps consisted exclusively  of three or four companies of footmen, and
was commanded by Major [Francis] Hargrove of  Wilkes County North Carolina, Godfrey Isaacks was one of the Captains.  We were drafted for  3. months, and were
marched through pretty much the same country as on my first tour,  and for the same
purpose.  I remember that it was a particular object of the expedition to go into  a part
of North Carolina where the Scotch very much abounded  We came to a part of the  country where the main American Army, commanded, by I do not recollect whom
[Horatio  Gates], had recently  passed [summer 1780?], and found ourselves in great
want of the means  of subsistence; after being marched about through the sandy parts of
North Carolina, two  months without meeting with any parties of Tories or having any
engagement we were  marched back to our own County having learned there was more
occasion for us there than  where we had been.  not long after we marched home we
were dismissed by our Officers  without receiving any formal discharge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  In addition to
these two tours of service performed by  me, I will state that Col. Benjamin Cleveland,
who lived on the Yadkin, Wilkes County North  Carolina, early in the Revolutionary
War, by his personal influence formed an association or  Company of mountain men, to
go against Tories whenever called on;  of this company I was a  member, and performed
under him many tours of duty of from one to three weeks at a time,  amounting in all to&nbsp;
at least 3. months.  We invariably went out as mounted gun men or rangers;  We ranged
principally on the mountains and New River.  On these excursions I remember, we  took
two parties of Tories, one consisting of 15, the other of 10, or 12 men.  They had been  engaged in plundering neighborhoods.  Some of these were hung, Shot others, and
others that  we took across the Virginia line, we delivered to the Virginians.  On another
occasion learning  that a Party of Hessian Dragoons and tories to the number of 12, or
15. passing up New River,  plundering and pillaging the country, we assembled, and
overtook them at the house of our  militia Captain (Paul Patrick,) whom they had under
guard, and where they were regaling  themselves on the best [?] the house afforded, we
surprised them killed [2.?], wounded 2,  whom we took prisoners, together with one
other.  One of the wounded prisoners, was a  Hessian, and lived.  His name was John
Meidenner [?].  He joined our side, and was one of the  men who served with me under
Capt Beverly.&nbsp;</p>
