<p>I know very little about Frederick Clemons.&nbsp; Estimating from early
census records, he was probably born about 1782.&nbsp; On the 1880 census,
several of his children list Maryland as their father's birthplace.&nbsp;He married Nancy Hunter
in about 1812 and most likely in Madison County.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nancy was the oldest child
of <a href="LinkJohnHunter.htm"> John Hunter and Ruth Gennett</a>.&nbsp; She was born about 1788, in
Goochland, Virginia. I can't find Frederick or Nancy Clemons on the 1850 or 1860 census.&nbsp; I assume
they died prior to
1850.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Children of Frederick Clemons and Nancy Hunter</font></b></p>
<p><b>1. <a href="LinkRobertJones.htm"> Mary Jane Clemons</a> </b> was born about 1813, in Madison County.&nbsp;
She married <a href="LinkRobertJones.htm">Robert Jones</a>, son of <a href="LinkHumphreyJones.htm"> Humphrey Jones and Susannah Gentry</a> on 13 July
1831, (bond 12 July 1831),&nbsp; in Madison County, with William Hunter as the bondsman and Frederick
Clemons as the father of the bride.&nbsp;Mary was listed as Jane on her marriage
license, as Mary on the 1850, 1860 and 1870 censuses, and as Polly on the 1880
census.</p>
<p><b>2. Elizabeth Clemons</b> was born about 1814 in Madison.&nbsp; She married 1st
Jeremiah Lamb on 22 June 1829 (bond) in Madison County.&nbsp; John Hunter was bondsman
and Frederick Clemons was listed as the father of the bride.&nbsp; She married a
2nd time to Timothy Lakes, son of Timothy Lakes and Rebecca Jones, on 1 March 1845 (bond) in Madison
County with William Hill
bondsman and Rebecca Lakes listed as the mother of the groom.&nbsp;William Hill
was the brother in law of Timothy Lakes.<br>
<br>
<b>
3. John B. Clemons</b> was born about 1815 in Madison County. He married Catherine Winkler
on 18 January 1838 in Madison, with Jackson Owens as bondsman and Francis
Winkler as mother of the bride.&nbsp;In Bill and
Kathy Vockery's book, <EM>Madison County Kentucky Marriage Records,
Vol 2, 1823-1851</EM>, they list the mother of the bride as Katharine
Winkler, but the original bond clearly shows the mother of the bride listed
as Francis Winkler.</p>

<p><i>Jackson
County Circuit Court, November term, 1858, 1st day:</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>p.
  2 The Commonwealth of Kentucky against John Clemmons - Malicious stabbing</p>

  day came the attorney for the Commonwealth and the defendant in person on
  motion of the attorney for the plaintiff, it is ordered that this cause be
  continued until next term. The defendant being in custody and admitted for
  bail. James Isaacs came personally into court and acknowledged himself
  indebted to the commonwealth of Kentucky in the sum of two hundred and fifty

  and shall at all times render himself amenable to the orders and process of
  said court in the prosecution of said charge and if convicted will render

  conditions, he will pay the commonwealth of Kentucky the sum of Two hundred

  Rockcastle for Richard Singleton and William Cates, as witnesses in behalf of
  the Commonwealth against said Clemmons and that summons sent to Jackson County
  for Mitton Martin as a witness in the above cause in behalf of the
  Commonwealth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Clemons was also indicted for perjury.&nbsp; John's son in law, James R.
Isaacs, was indicted for murder during the same period.&nbsp; These two evens
might be connected, especially since James R. Isaacs' father, James Isaacs, paid
the bail for John Clemons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the November 1860 term of the Jackson County Circuit Court the perjury
charge was &quot;filed away&quot; and during the November 1863 term the
malicious stabbing charge was dismissed.</p>
<p><i>Jackson County Court Records, October term, 1878</i>:</p>
