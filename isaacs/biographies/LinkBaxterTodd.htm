<p>Baxter Todd and Elizabeth Mitchell were married 13 August 1833 in Madison
County.&nbsp; I am not sure who Baxter Todd's parents were.&nbsp; Annie Walker
Burns Bell's book, <i>Madison County Kentucky Marriages 1785-1851</i> lists:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Backster Todd, father: Caleb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; married Eliz Mitchell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7-30-1833&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  bondsman: Major
  Johnson&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill and Kathy Vockery's book, <i>Madison county Kentucky Marriage Records
Vol. II, 1823-1851:</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Groom:&nbsp; Baxter Todd -&nbsp; Bride: Elizabeth Mitchell - Bond date: 30
  July 1833 - Bondsman: Major Johnson - Grandfather of the Groom: Joseph Todd -
  Mother of the Groom:&nbsp; Mary Todd - Listed on bond but relationship
  unknown: Nancy Mitchell - Marriage Return: 13 August 1833.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this marriage return on the microfilm of the Madison County Court
Marriage Records:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>And on the 13th day of August, Baxter Todd and Elizabeth Mitchell, 1833</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baxter Todd was born in about 1814.&nbsp; Caleb Todd was born in about 1794,
so he was old enough to be Baxter's father.&nbsp; However, the first record of a
marriage for Caleb Todd that I have found was 28 January 1817 to Franky
Roberts.&nbsp; There could have been an earlier marriage, or there could have
been a child without a marriage.&nbsp; But I haven't found any proof of either
as of yet.&nbsp; I think that that fact that these first two records are so
completely different from each other calls one or both of them into question.&nbsp;
A lot of research needs to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Hubert W. Cox,&nbsp; author of <i>Todds of Madison County</i>,
Joseph Todd married Mary Berry, and didn't have a son Caleb.&nbsp; But
considering the number of Todds that married other Todds, Jospeh might just have
likely been Baxter's maternal grandfather as paternal grandfather.&nbsp; If the Vockery's book is correct, and
Joseph was Baxter's grandfather, than the Mary listed might have actually been
Baxter's grandmother, rather than his mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> I can't find Caleb Todd on
the 1820, 1830 or 1840 census. He was most likely
living with another family and enumerated in their household.&nbsp; Caleb did
appear on the 1850 census in Madison County with his wife Susan Cradlebough.&nbsp;
There were no children in the household.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Mitchell was born in about 1813 in Madison County,&nbsp; the daughter of William Mitchell and Nancy
Estes.&nbsp; Since Baxter married for a second time in 1866, it seems likely
that Elizabeth died sometime between 1860 and 1865.&nbsp; Baxter's second
marriage was to Martha Jane Norris on 10 July 1866 in Madison County.&nbsp;
Baxter doesn't appear on the 1880 census.</p>
