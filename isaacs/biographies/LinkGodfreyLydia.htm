<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Godfrey Isaacs and Lydia Morris</font></b></p>
<p>Godfrey Isaacs and Lydia Morris were married about 1846, most likely in Owsley
County.&nbsp; The Owsley County court house fire of 1929 destroyed approximately
5000 marriage records.&nbsp; In the book, <i>Owsley County, Kentucky Marriages
1843-1929</i>, Robert L. Smith has attempted to replace those lost marriage
records with data from other sources.&nbsp; I think this is a valuable research
tool, but I have found several errors.&nbsp; One of which is the marriage listing for
Godfrey Isaacs and Lydia Morris.&nbsp; Mr. Smith lists the parents of Godfrey as Godfrey Isaacs and Elizabeth Howard.&nbsp; We know from the probate
information found in the Jackson County land records that Godfrey Isaacs
(1775-1858)&nbsp; and Elizabeth
Howard's son Godfrey married Emiline Crawford.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Godfrey Isaacs who married Lydia Morris was the son of <a href="LinkGodfreyKeziah.htm"> Godfrey Isaacs and
Keziah Johnson</a>.&nbsp; We can establish this relationship with the probate
records of his father Godfrey (1793-1863) which are also found in the Jackson County land
records.&nbsp; Both Godfreys, the son of Godfrey and Elizabeth as well as the
son of Godfrey and Keziah, served in the Civil War.&nbsp; Their respective
pension records also provide information that establishes their identity. However, all these Godfreys are very
confusing.&nbsp; Both Godfreys have fathers named
Godfrey.&nbsp; The son of Godfrey Isaacs and Keziah Johnson was born about 1825,
and the son of <a href="LinkGodfreyBetsy.htm"> Godfrey Isaacs and Elizabeth Howard</a> was born about 1826.&nbsp;
One way to help separate the two Godfreys is that Godfrey and Keziah's son
Godfrey lived in Owsley County in 1850, and appeared on the census in Jackson County in 1860,
1870, and 1880 &nbsp; This same Godfrey also appeared on the 1890 Federal Civil
War pensioners list for Jackson
County.
Since part of Owsley County was used to form Jackson County in 1858, it is likely that
Godfrey and Lydia lived in and around the same neighborhood their entire married
life.&nbsp; Godfrey and Elizabeth Howard's son, Godfrey was in Madison County in 1850,
and appeared consistently in Estill County until he and his wife
Emiline moved to Texas in the1890's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lydia Morris was the daughter of George Morris and Elizabeth Johnson.
According to cemetery records Lydia was born 22 December 1820 and died 10 January
1913 in Jackson County, Kentucky.&nbsp; Civil War pension documents&nbsp;
indicate her husband Godfrey
Isaacs died 28 February 1896, in Egypt, Jackson, Kentucky.&nbsp; On the 1900
census, Lydia was listed as a widow, age 79.&nbsp; She was living with her son,
William.&nbsp; Susan Isaac has a picture of the tombstones of both Godfrey and
Lydia on her website:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Plains/7895/Isaac.htm">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Plains/7895/Isaac.htm</a></p>
<p> During the Civil War, Godfrey first served&nbsp; in Company D, 7th KY
Volunteer Infantry, as a 2nd Lieutenant.&nbsp; He became very sick with the
measles during the last part of September 1861, and eventually resigned in March
of 1862.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Godfrey
re-enlisted in July of 1863, in Company A, 47th KY Volunteer
(Mounted) Infantry as a 1st Lieutenant, and officially served for an additional seven
months after being mustered (May 1864).&nbsp; Godfrey applied for a pension and
was granted one in 1875.&nbsp; Because the veracity of his
pension application was challenged by several of his enemies, a special
examination was called regarding him.&nbsp; After getting depositions from many
family members and friends, Godfrey was exonerated.&nbsp; This examination added
about 200 pages of information to Godfrey's Civil War file, and provides us
with invaluable family information, notably an explanation of the death of
Godfrey's parents and three siblings. I have included much of that application
below.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Children of Godfrey Isaacs and Lydia Morris</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>1. Emilia Maria Isaacs</b> was born about 1847, probably in Owsley
County.&nbsp; On the 1850 census she was listed as Emilia.&nbsp; On the 1860
census she was listed as Maria.&nbsp; On the 1870 census she was listed as Mariah
Wood.&nbsp; At that time she was living with her parents and her three year old daughter,
Martha Wood. There was no husband listed.&nbsp; In 1880,
Martha Wood age 12, born June 1867, was living with her grandparents, Godfrey
and Lydia, but her
mother, Emilia Maria wasn't there.&nbsp; Martha was listed as deformed.&nbsp; On
the 1900 census, Martha was listed as Martha Isaacs, rather than Wood, and was living with her widowed grandmother Lydia
Isaacs.&nbsp; Both Lydia and Martha were enumerated in the household of William T.
Isaacs and his wife Rebecca.&nbsp;William Isaacs was the youngest child of
Godfrey Isaacs and Lydia Morris.&nbsp; On the 1900 census, Lydia listed herself
as the mother of four children, three of whom were currently living.&nbsp;&nbsp; Emilia
Maria would have been her non-surviving child since her other children all
appear on the 1900 census in Jackson County.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>2. Keziah/Kizzie Isaacs</b> was born 14 August 1848 in Owsley
County, according to Ron Rader's family tree on Ancestry.com.&nbsp; She appeared on the 1850 census as Kisia and was listed as a female.&nbsp;
She
appeared
on the 1860 census of Jackson county as Hezekiah or something that looked very
much like Hezekiah and was listed as a male.&nbsp;Ron Rader's family tree lists
Keziah's marriage to Henry Rader as 23 January 1866 in Egypt, Jackson
County.&nbsp; Henry and Kizzie Rader were living next door to William T. Isaacs
on the 1900 census.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>3. Francis Marion</b> Isaacs was born May 1850 in Owsley
County.&nbsp; He was listed on the 1850 census as Francis M. and a female.&nbsp;
Since all of the children in the household were listed as females in 1850 it
seems that Francis' incorrect listing could be explained as simple
enumerator error.&nbsp; However, Francis M. was also listed as a female on the
1860 census.&nbsp; I don't really have an explanation for the error, but his
sister Keziah was listed as a male on the same census.&nbsp; Maybe the
enumerator just wasn't very careful.&nbsp; Francis was listed as a male on the 1870 census, and he married Sarah Bunnam on 26 July 1877 in Jackson County.&nbsp; Francis M.
was also listed
as a male on the 1880 and 1900 censuses.&nbsp; According to the 1900 census, Sarah
Bunnam Isaacs was born May 1856 in Kentucky. She indicated that she had been married 22 years and was the mother of 10 children, 9 of
whom were living.</font></p>
<p><b>4. William Thomas Isaacs</b> was born&nbsp; 29 May 1852 in Owsley County.&nbsp; He
married Rebecca Jane Gabbard in about 1873.&nbsp; I haven't been able to find a
record of the marriage.&nbsp; Rebecca was born May 1852 in Kentucky, and was the daughter of Jacob
Gabbard and Elizabeth Woods.&nbsp; On the 1900 census, she indicated that she
had been married 27 years and was the mother of 11 children, all of whom were
still living.&nbsp; William's father, Godfrey, and Rebecca's
father Jacob served together during the Civil War.&nbsp; A picture of them can
be found on Susan Isaac's website at:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Plains/7895/Isaac.htm">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Plains/7895/Isaac.htm</a></p>
<p align="center"><b>Civil War Service of Godfrey Isaacs</b></p>
<p><font size="3">Godfrey Isaacs joined Company D, 7th Kentucky Infantry as a 2nd
Lieutenant on 19
August 1861 and his resignation was accepted 22 March 1862.&nbsp; In July of 1863&nbsp; he joined Company A, 47th
Kentucky Mounted Infantry and was mustered as a 1st Lieutenant on
13 May
1864 at Lexington.&nbsp; He was mustered out as a 1st Lieutenant on Dec 26, 1864.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">A certificate was issued on 28 April 1875 to Godfrey Isaacs
granting him a pension.&nbsp; In October, 1877, Godfrey's name was dropped from
the pension roll on the recommendation of Special Agent Arthur Shephard, who
conducted an investigation into allegations made against Godfrey claiming that his
disability existed prior to his enlistment.&nbsp; On the 29th of December 1883,
Godfrey filed a claim for restoration to the rolls, and his case was referred for
special examination to determine the question of &quot;prior soundness and
general merits.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Godfrey's original claim was that while at Camp Wild Cat,
Kentucky, in September 1861, he contracted measles and that afterwards, &quot;while
serving as a picket on the Barboursville Road,&quot; near
London, Kentucky, he suffered a relapse.&nbsp; According to Godfrey, as a result
of the measles and the relapse, he suffered chronic bronchitis.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">During the special examination no less than 27 people were
deposed.&nbsp; In the end, Mr. A. C. Welch, the Special Examiner had this to
say:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>After a careful examination of the claim I am of the opinion that there is
  no good ground for doubt that the steps taken to stop the pension were
  prompted by malice and prejudice.&nbsp; There is already a great deal of
  testimony in&nbsp; the case of prior soundness, incurrence and condition since
  discharge.&nbsp; The claimant was ready to furnish much more testimony as to
  condition from 1857 to 1861, also more comrades.&nbsp; I am convinced that the
  claim is meritorious, and recommend that the pensioner's name be restored to
  the roll.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3">Mr. Welch also made observations concerning some of the
individuals who tried to stop Godfrey's pension.&nbsp; Regarding M.(Mark) D.
Settles he said, &quot;This witness is a man of good reputation for truth; but
it appears he is regarded as having become greatly prejudiced against the
claimant who was a member of the grand jury which found a true bill against his
son for tampering with the county records.&quot;&nbsp; Regarding John Pennington
he said, &quot;This witness is also a man of good reputation, but has heretofore
been deeply prejudiced against the claimant.&quot;&nbsp; Regarding John Rader,
Sr. he said, &quot;This witness is very ignorant and illiterate, but has
heretofore enjoyed a good reputation for truth.&nbsp; His malice toward the
claimant is blinding and it is notorious that he would stop at nothing if he
could injure the claimant thereby.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Below is a list of the depositions obtained. In some
cases I have included the entire deposition and in some cases only excerpts.&nbsp;
NOTE: A.H. Clark was both the Captain of the first Company (D, 7th KY) that
Godfrey served in from 1861-1862 and Colonel of the second Regiment (47th KY)
that Godfrey served in from 1863-1864.&nbsp; John Pennington was the Captain of
the second Company (A, 47th KY) that Godfrey served in from 1863-1864.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On this 23rd day of June 1884 at Pond Creek, County of
Jackson, State of Kentucky, before me, A.C. Welch, a Special Examiner of the
Pension Office, personally appeared <b> Gotfrey Isaacs</b> who.. [the part about being
sworn in is all crossed out.]</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I am fifty-nine years old, a farmer and my post office is
Tyner, Jackson Co. Ky.&nbsp; I enlisted on the 19th day of August 1861&nbsp; in
Co. D, 7th Ky Inf as Second Lieut. in this county, and was mustered in at Camp
Dick Robinson in Garrard Co. Ky. sometime about the last of September.&nbsp; Dr.
Pope, now dead, as I understand examined me before I was mustered in.&nbsp; As
far as I can recollect about it at this time, he made me take my coat off and
thumped me about the chest and under the shoulders, put his ear at my ribs and
under my shoulder, also felt my pulse.&nbsp; That is about as much as I
recollect of the examination.&nbsp; I was free from any disease at that time,
and thought I was sound as any man.&nbsp; We were at Camp Dick Robinson about a
month before muster in, after muster in the Regiment moved to Camp Wild Cat in
Laurel Co., Ky.&nbsp; It was about the last of September 1861, that we reached
Camp Wild Cat.&nbsp; The march only took us about two days.&nbsp; It rained all
one day while we were on the march, and I began to take sick on the march, but
did not know it was measles at that time.&nbsp; The next day after we got to
Wild Cat, Col. T. G. Garrett [T.T. Garrard] sent me across the county to the Old State road
about six or seven miles to prevent the citizens blocking the road.&nbsp; I
performed that duty and while retiring to camp became so sick I had to stay at
Chas Spivey's house about two or three miles from the Camp.&nbsp; The place I
was sent to by Col. Garrett was right in the immediate neighborhood of my own
house and I stayed at home about 12 hours and then started back to camp.&nbsp;
My wife, knowing me to be sick, followed my and overtook me.&nbsp; I don't
recollect ever getting to Spivey's and don't remember how many days I was unconscious.&nbsp;
The first I recollect of was the doctor from the regiment, Dr. Hagan who died
last October, or sometime in the fall, coming there to treat me.&nbsp; I don't
recollect, but I expect I stayed at Spivey's about ten days.&nbsp; My wife then
took me home, on the consent of Col. Garrett, and I stayed there about three
weeks or a month and then rejoined the regiment a few days after I got to
London.&nbsp; I was still very feeble.&nbsp; I remained on duty about two or
three weeks and was sent out on to Barborsville road with a squad of men as a
picket and during that time I got pretty wet (it rained on us all night) and
I got sick and took a desperate fever and cough and miserable hurting in my
breast.&nbsp; That was sometime in November or first of December.&nbsp; I
remained so sick as to be unable to perform any duty or to keep with the
regiment until about the 5th or 6th of March I came up with it at Cumberland
Ford. During the time I was sick in London at that&nbsp; time I was under Dr. Wm
Berry's treatment.&nbsp; He lives in Louisville, Ky.&nbsp; The regiment did not
leave London till sometime in February and I had no other treatment except that
give me by Dr. Berry.&nbsp; When I came up with the regiment I found that I could
not stand the service and Dr. Berry told me the measles had settled on my
lungs.&nbsp; He advised me to resign and I did so on the 7th of March, 1862, as
well as I now remember. After I resigned I came right home.&nbsp; All that
summer I was very feeble.&nbsp; I had no medical treatment during that summer
but continued to take Baker's Cod Liver Oil and whisky as advised by Dr.
Berry.&nbsp; He also told me to keep myself out of the weather during the winter
and spring.&nbsp; In the summer of 1863, I was some better.&nbsp; In July, 1863, I think, I enlisted in Co. A. 47th
Ky Inf as First Lieut, at McKee,
Jackson Co. Ky., and was not mustered until May 13, 1864, so says my muster
roll.&nbsp; Those who enlisted at the same time as I did were mustered in
shortly after enlistment.&nbsp; I was informed that before I could be mustered I
would have to be examined by a doctor, (I think a brigade doctor) to see whether
or not I had sufficiently recovered from the disability on account of which I had
resigned from the 7th Ky to be accepted in the service.&nbsp; I went to
Lexington, Ky, and handed him the paper ordering&nbsp; me before the doctor, He
only asked me a few questions but made no physical examination and then in about
two or three weeks afterwards I was mustered in.&nbsp; We were camped at
Nicholasville or Camp Nelson then.&nbsp; During that service I had a spell of hoarseness
and cough.&nbsp; I was discharged the 25th or 26th of December 1864
when the regiment was mustered out.&nbsp; I was not in hospital at any time
during the second service.&nbsp; I was treated while we were at Nicholsville by
the same Dr. Rose as I have already spoken of for this hoarseness and
cough.&nbsp; About all the duty my company did was to guard railroad stations
from the time of my muster until the time of my discharge.&nbsp; I was able to
knock around a little and ride but was not able to labor and I have not done a
full days work from the date of my discharge until now on account of my
disability.&nbsp; I claimed pension on account of disease of lungs resulting
from relapse from measles contracted in the service.&nbsp; I reckon fully
one-forth of our regiment and probably more was taken down with measles at Wild
Cat at the same time as I was.&nbsp; Pension was granted me on that claim and
afterwards I filed a claim for increase.&nbsp; It was for the same disease and
for the same symptoms but for an increase degree of disability.&nbsp; My pension
was stopped about Nov 1877.&nbsp; I think the reason why it was stopped was from
some prejudice James Bales, John Pennington and John Rader, had against me.&nbsp;
The trouble between me and Rader is I refused to pay him compound interest on my
indebtedness to him for apiece of land I bought from him.&nbsp; He also told me
that another course of his enmity against me was that my wife had reported
seeing him at the house of a loose woman.&nbsp; Pennington and I have been
bitter political opponents.&nbsp; Bales became embittered against me on account
of a family matter.&nbsp; Mrs. Elizabeth Truitt, Rachel Johnson, Dr. Johnson,
Sam'l Casteel all connected in some way with Pennington, Bales and Rader. I
understand have sworn against me.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q: What sicknesses had you before enlistment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: I had the mumps in May or June 1853.&nbsp; In two or three
weeks I got all right again.&nbsp; In 1857 I was taken sick with sickness of the
stomach, headache and high fever and remained that way for several days.&nbsp;
Dr. Dowell, since dead came drunk to visit me, and I did not take his
prescription.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q: Had you any pains in your side at that time</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: No, sir.&nbsp; I did not nor no cough.&nbsp; I was confined
to my room about 10 days.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q. What time of year was it</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: My recollection of it is that it was about the last of May
or first of June.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q: Had you been caught in any rain or any undue exposure
about that time</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: Not that I recollect of.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q: To what cause did you attribute that spell of sickness</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: I just supposed it was foul stomach.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q: Had you any other sickness but those you have spoken of</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: I never lost a meal of victuals on account of sickness from
the time I was a boy until I went into the service except for the mumps and that
spell of sickness I have told you of.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q: Did you ever receive any injury before you went into the
service</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: I was thrown from my horse, before I was grown, against the
end of a trimmed log and my left temple cut making a gash about two inches
long.&nbsp; It left a numbness in that temple.&nbsp; I understand that Martha
Culton swore that I had a buckskin cord put under my left shoulder for misery in
the breast and a bad cough, but I had nothing of the kind done.&nbsp; Dr.
Burnham who has fled the country, for over 20 years, put a little cord on my
left shoulder by the side of my neck to take away the numbness in my left temple
and it did so.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q: Please give me the names of witnesses by whom you can
prove your soundness before enlistment.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: Mr. Jesse McWhirter, P. M. of High Knob, Ky.&nbsp; Dr. Jas
D. Forster, London, Ky, my family physician up to enlistment.&nbsp; Dr. O.T.
Asbell of Chinquapin Rough, Ky, Elbert G. Bowles, Tyner, Ky.&nbsp; John
Hamilton, McKee, Ky and all the witnesses who have made affidavits on that point
in my favor if necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q: Give me the names and addressees of any commissioned
officers and comrades or doctor who can testify to the measure of your
disability.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: Lieut. Andrew Hurd, Travellers Rest, Ky, Major Elisha
Treadway, Brooneville, Ky., John Hamilton of McKee, and Elbert Bowles.&nbsp;

<p><font size="3"><i>Q: What witnesses have you for the degree of disability
showed since discharge.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: A number of those already mentioned and any number more of
my neighbors if necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>Q: Do you desire to be present in person or be represented
by attorney or both during this examination.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A: I want to be present when the witnesses against me are
examined, but do not care to be present during the taking of the testimony of my
own witnesses that I have mentioned.</font></p>

<p>Case of Gotfrey Isaacs, No. 133,155</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this 24th day of June, 1884, at Chinquapin Rough,
County of Jackson, State of Ky, before me, A.C. Welch, a Special Examiner of the
Pension Office, personally appeared <b>Samuel Johnston</b>, who being by me
first duly sworn to answer truly all interrogatories propounded to him during
this special Examination of afore said pension claim, deposes and says:</p>
<p><i>Q: What is your, age, profession and post office address</i></p>
<p>A: Age 75, physician, Moore's Creek, Jackson Co. Ky</p>
<p><i>Q: When did you first become acquainted with Mr. Isaacs</i></p>
<p>A: I don't know now, but it was before Owsley Co. was formed [1843].&nbsp; Somewhere
between 30 and 40 years.</p>
<p><i>Q: How near did you live to Mr. Isaacs during the years from 1850 to 1861.</i></p>
<p>A: Part of the time 20 add miles, the balance of the time I don't remember
where he lived and only occasionally saw him.</p>
<p><i>Q: Were you at any time from 1850 to 1861, so&nbsp;intimately acquainted
with his physical condition as to be able to state it with any degree of
certainly.</i></p>
<p>A: No, sir, I cannot state that.&nbsp; I only saw him occasionally.&nbsp;
Occasionally I heard him complain of not being well.</p>
<p><i>Q: What did he complain of.</i></p>
<p>A: I don't recollect as I can state that. On one occasion going up to Isaac
Gabbard's he complained of being not able to work.&nbsp; Once when my wife and
son had been to association on Sturgeon and I think as he returned with them on
his way to Gabbards and I think he complained of his breast hurting him.&nbsp; I
cannot say what year that was, but I know it was before the war.</p>
<p><i>Q: Did you ever at any of the time but this that you speak of, when he was
returning from the association, hear him complain of his breast</i></p>
<p>A: No, sir, not that I remember of</p>
<p><i>Q: Are you positive that as a matter of fact he did on that occasion when
coming from the association complain of his breasts</i></p>
<p>A: Yes, sir.&nbsp; I think I am. My mind serves me that way that he was
complaining in some way of his breast. From a conversation had with my wife my
memory was judged that I did remember him complaining of his breast at
that&nbsp; time.</p>
<p><i>Q: When did you have that conversation with your wife.</i></p>
<p>A: I don't remember when it was last.&nbsp; It was when a pension agent
called at my house and took my wife's statement.</p>
<p><i>Q: Were you intimately acquainted with his physical condition at the time
of his enlistment.</i></p>
<p>A: No, sir.</p>
<p><i>Q: Do know know what his condition has been since the war.</i></p>
<p>A: Nothing in the world but what I have heard him say.&nbsp; He seems to be
in feeble health.</p>
<p><i>Q: How far apart do you live</i></p>
<p>A: About 7 or 8 miles.</p>
<p><i>Q: Do you practice in his neighborhood</i></p>
<p>A: No, sir, not at all.</p>
<p><i>Q: Are you in any way prejudice against the claimant or have you ever had
any trouble, a difference with him either in politics or religion.</i></p>
<p>A: Never in the world.&nbsp; We differed in politics and religion but I have
no hard feelings for him.</p>
<p><b>Cross examined by Claimant:</b></p>
<p><i>Q: Are you a son-in-law of Judge Abel Pennington and brother-in -law of
John Pennington</i></p>
<p>A: Yes sir.&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Q: Did you live neighbor to him then</i></p>
<p>A: Yes sir, within a mile and a half or two miles.</p>
<p><i>Q: Do you know what the condition of his health was at that time he was a
neighbor</i></p>

<p><i>Q: Was your intimacy such as to enable you to say with anything like
certainty what his condition was during those years</i></p>

<p><i>Q: When did you first hear him complain of not being able to work</i></p>

Sheriff in 1863 and 1864 and he complained then</p>
<p><i>Q: Was it while you were Sheriff that you first heard him complain</i></p>
<p>A: Oh no I heard him complain before I was Sheriff</p>
<p><i>Q: How long or about how long before you were Sheriff was it that you

his enlistment.</i></p>
<p>A: No, sir.&nbsp; I do not.</p>
<p><i>Q: Did you regard him as a strong able bodied sound man just before the
war or did you consider him a weakly, feeble and unsound man.</i></p>
<p>A: He looked like he might be a strong man.&nbsp; I am no physician.&nbsp; He
looked like there was nothing the matter with him.</p>
<p><i>Q: Have you known his condition since discharge</i></p>
<p>A: I have seen him a good many time since discharge and he appeared very
frail</p>
<p><i>Q: Do you know what the trouble is</i></p>
<p>A: No, sir.&nbsp; I do not.&nbsp; I reckon I have heard him say but I don't
recollect what he complained&nbsp; of.</p>
<p><i>Q: Did you ever know of him having any spell of sickness before enlistment</i></p>
<p>A: I am not exactly positive whether I do or not.&nbsp; I remember seeing him

<p>Case of Gotfrey Isaacs, No. 133,155</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this 24th day of June, 1884, at Chinquapin Rough,
County of Jackson, State of Ky, before me, A.C. Welch, a Special Examiner of the
Pension Office, personally appeared <b>John Pennington</b>, who being by me
first duly sworn to answer truly all interrogatories propounded to him during
this special Examination of afore said pension claim, deposes and says:</p>
<p><i>Q: What is your, age, profession and post office address</i></p>
<p>A: Age 57, farmer, Chinquapin Rough, Jackson Co. Ky</p>
<p><i>Q: How long have you known Mr. Isaacs</i></p>
<p>A: My best recollection is that it was in 1844 I first knew him.</p>
<p><i>Q: Did you live neighbor to him at any time from 1850 to 1861</i></p>
<p>A: As well as I remember not nearer than 20 miles</p>
<p><i>Q: How frequently did you see him during the years from 1850 to 1861</i></p>
<p>A: Up to 1857 I did not see him but very seldom but from 1857 to 1861 we went
to the same county seat and I saw him about once a month</p>
<p><i>Q: What was the condition of his health when you knew him most intimately
before the commencement of the war</i></p>
<p>A: I cannot make any positive statement as to his health, only I noticed he
had a sort of cough.&nbsp; In 1859 we had a trade about a piece of land in the
Grayhawk country and I was selling him a yoke of cattle as a payment on the
land.&nbsp; He remarked that he must be careful about giving too much for stock
as he was not able to work.&nbsp; During the past five years sometime we had a
talk about it and he didn't recollect saying anything of that kind and said if
he did it must have been a joke.&nbsp; To look at him he appeared to be a man of
good health.</p>
<p><i>Q: Do you know of your own knowledge what the condition of his health was
at the time of his enlistment in the 7th Ky Inf.</i></p>
<p>A: No, sir. I do not.</p>
<p><i>Q: Do you know of your own knowledge what the condition of his health was
at the time of his enlistment in the 47th&nbsp; Ky Inf</i></p>
<p>A: Immediately after we got to camp I considered his health very bad.&nbsp; I
slept with him for some time after we got to camp and he was restless and
coughed a deal.&nbsp; His health was very indifferent I thought.</p>
<p><i>Q: Had you and he any conversations at that time as to what produced that
bad condition of health</i></p>
<p>A: I disremember ifini did have a conversation as to the cause of it.&nbsp;
[This is exactly as the sentence reads, I imagine he is saying, &quot;I don't
remember if I did...]</p>
<p><i>Q: Were you sufficiently intimate with him and did you see him after often
enough during the time from 1857 to 1861 to be able to judge with anything approaching
accuracy the state of his health during those years.</i></p>
<p>A: I could not make a definite statement as to his health during that
time.&nbsp; I _____ him have what appeared to be a dry cough, but his
appearance was that he was a sound man.</p>
<p><i>Q: In whose handwriting is this letter dated August 18, 1876, particularly
the lower portion and signature</i></p>
<p>A: My notion is that the upper portion is A.P. Settles, the lower portion is
mine, including the signature.&nbsp; My recollection is that my father had ___
upper part and asked me to insert the other names and sign his name to it.</p>
<p><i>Q: Are you and Mr. Isaacs good friends now</i></p>
<p>A: On my part we are.&nbsp; I have nothing against Mr. Isaacs.&nbsp; I only
want to make a fair statement and would be truly glad if Mr. Isaacs could succeed
in getting a pension.</p>
<p><i>Q: Were you and Mr. Isaacs quite friendly in August 1876</i></p>
<p>A: That was the year that I ran for Sheriff, I think, and he was very
strongly opposed to me and wanted me beaten.&nbsp; I was beaten.&nbsp; We had
also had some little differences while in the service in the 47th Ky.&nbsp; I
don't think there was any particular friendliness between us in 1876, but
nothing particularly cross between us at least on my part.</p>
<p><i>Q: Have you been intimate with his condition since the close of the war,
and if so please state to what extent he has been disabled from earning a subsistence
by manual labor during that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: I have been intimate with his condition during that time and from his
appearance I don't think to do himself justice he has been in a condition to do
any labor at all.</p>
<p><i>Q: What seems to be the trouble with him</i></p>
<p>A: He has had a tremendous cough all the time and spit up a great deal.</p>
<p><i>Q: Did you ever know him to complain of pains in his throat and chest
before the war - except when you and he were making the cattle trade.</i></p>
<p>A: I recollect him complaining of his breast.&nbsp; I don't remember of him
complaining about his throat.</p>
<p><i>Q: When did you hear him complain of his breast</i></p>
<p>A: I couldn't memorize the times.&nbsp; I stayed all night with him one night
at Hardin Sloans in McKee and he complained then considerably of his
breast.&nbsp; I cannot say what year it was but somewhere between 1857 and
1860.&nbsp; I never knew of him having any serious sickness before the war.</p>

didn't say what date that was but it was before the war he said.&nbsp; We had no
understanding about it.</p>
<p><b>Cross-examined by Claimant</b></p>
<p><i>Q: Did Mr. M.D. Settles Jr. a son-in-law of Bales come to you and tell you
that Mr. James Bales and me were security for another man and for you to hold up
writing to the Department about my pension until the debt was paid so as not to
make me mad and leave Bales to pay the debt</i></p>
<p>A: Pretty near to that account.&nbsp; That if Mr. Isaacs got mad he would
have the debt to pay himself.</p>
<p><i>Q: Did you tell Mr. Settles that you would hold up provided I would let
you alone</i></p>
<p>A: If I did I don't recollect it.&nbsp; Mr. Isaacs never interrupted me in
his life.</p>

forgot about it.</p>
<p><i>Q: Were you present when R. P. Settles wrote a letter to the Department in
Abel Pennington's name and referred to you, John Pennington and others in that
letter as to my not being entitled to pension.</i></p>
<p>A: Mr. James Gregory told me they wanted me to come down to Bales and when I
went they were all at Settles.&nbsp; They asked me if I knowed Mr. Isaacs before
the war and asked me if he was sickly and I said he told me he was.&nbsp; I
don't know whether he was sickly or not and then Capt Pennington he began to
write and Alex Settles snatched the paper from him and said you don't know how
to write and he did the writing and then I started home and I don't know how
they fixed it.&nbsp; I don't know who signed their names to it, or who did not</p>
<p><i>Q: Who were at Settles</i></p>
<p>A: I don't recollect now who was. Aleck Settles and John Pennington
was.&nbsp; I don't know whether there was any other there or not.</p>
<p><i>Q: Were we perfectly intimate and visited one another until the time we
had the dispute about the interest</i></p>
<p>A: Yes.&nbsp; I believe that is all right</p>

<p>Case of Gotfrey Isaacs, No. 133,155</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this 27th day of June, 1884, at Chinquapin Rough, County of
Jackson, State of Ky, before me, A.C. Welch, a Special Examiner of the Pension
Office, personally appeared <b>James Bales</b>, who being by me first duly
sworn to answer truly all interrogatories propounded to him during this special
Examination of afore said pension claim, deposes and says:</p>
<p><i>Q: What is your, age, profession and post office address</i></p>
<p>A: 64 next November, farmer, Chinquapin Rough, Ky.</p>
<p><i>Q: When did you first become acquainted with Mr. Isaacs</i></p>
<p>A: I expect about thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Q: How close did you live to him at any time from 1850 to 1861</p>
<p>A: In the fall of 1857 or spring of 1858 I lived within about one mile of him
in the Clover Bottom country</p>
<p>Q: How long did you continue to live near him there</p>
<p>A: I lived by him there about a year and a half</p>
<p>Q: Did you ever work with him down there in log rollings, house raisings or
anything of that kind.</p>
<p>A: I think so.&nbsp; It was a rough country and we had a good deal of that to
do.</p>
<p>Q: What was the condition of his health during the time he lived near
neighbor to you in the Clover Bottom country</p>
<p>A: Well, sir, the fall he moved there his health was rather feeble.&nbsp; He
had a spell of pneumonia fever while he lived at the Edwards place about
Grayhawk just before he moved down there.&nbsp; But next spring he was all right
again and did a hard summers work, and from then on until he went into the army
his health was all right.&nbsp; We both went into the same regiment.</p>
<p>Q: Were you a member of Co. D, 7th Ky Inf.</p>
<p>A: Yes sir</p>
<p>Q: What was the condition of Mr. Isaacs health at the time of his enlistment</p>
<p>A: I thought it was mighty good sir.&nbsp; I took him to be a sound man sir.</p>
<p>Q: Do you know whether he contracted any disease in the service</p>
<p>A: Yes, sir.&nbsp; In the winter of 1861 he took very sick at London, Ky
lying in the mud and came very near dying.&nbsp; We all expected him to
die.&nbsp; Dr. Berry waited on him and after the regiment left there I don't
think he was even with it any more except on a visit to it.&nbsp; That's what I
think started his disease, the cold settled on his lungs and he had a very bad
cough.&nbsp; I visited his room frequently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Do you know what his condition was immediately after your return from the
service.</p>
<p>A: I think his condition was bad when I first saw him, and he has been in a
puny condition all the time.&nbsp; I don't think he has had any good health ever
since.</p>
<p>Q: To what extent is he now disabled for the performance of manual labor by
reason of his health.</p>
<p>A: I don't know he is able to do any kind of labor at all and he has not been
able to do any for a long time.</p>
<p>Q: Did you ever know or hear before the war of him&nbsp; being a delicate,
sickly man.</p>
<p>A: No, sir.&nbsp; I knew him 10 or 12 years before the war and I knew him to
be a very active able bodied man.&nbsp; I became acquainted with him about 1845.</p>
<p>Q: Do you think if he had been a delicate, sickly man prior to enlistment you
would have been likely to know it.</p>
<p>A: I think I would, sir.&nbsp; I saw him frequently and he was a stout hearty
man.</p>
<p>Q: What did you know about the effort that was made some years go about
stopping Mr. Isaacs pension.</p>
<p>A: Some years ago in the spring after an election in which John Pennington
was a candidate there was a house raising at Alex Settles, one of my sons-in-law
and at it were Judge Abel Pennington, John Pennington and John Rader Sr.&nbsp;
and while they were at work they sent for me, and asked me about his health and
so on and I told them of the spell of sickness he had at the Edwards place and
they wrote up to Washington to try and stop his pension and after a while a
letter came from Washington to me to answer and knowing it was all done from
malice and prejudice I laid the letter up on the fire board and never answered
it.&nbsp; Judge Abel Pennington was at the head of it</p>
<p>Q: Do you know why Abel Pennington was prejudiced against Mr. Isaacs</p>
<p>A: Nothing but a prejudice he got against Mr. Isaacs about the
election.&nbsp; I think that was the ____ of it all and he was a mighty
prejudiced old man.</p>
<p>Q: Do you know what Mr. John Rader Sr. was prejudiced against Mr. Isaacs
for.</p>
<p>A: I don't know what made him fall out with Gotfrey.</p>
<p>Q: Had he been friends with Gotfrey&nbsp; up to a short time before that
election</p>
<p>A: I think he had.&nbsp; I thought before going to that house raising that
they were the best of friends, but in going there he told me that Abel
Pennington, John Pennington and himself were to meet there and what they were
going to do and I didn't think any more about it until they sent in for me.</p>
<p><b>Cross examined by Claimant:</b></p>
<p>Q: Did John Rader Sr. ask you while going over to that working to aid him in
stopping my pension.</p>
<p>A: He asked me what I knew about him and told him about that spell of
sickness.&nbsp; He told me what he and the Penningtons were going to do and it
did not meet my approbation.</p>
<p>Q: Did you get Mark Settles to go to Rader to get him to hold up sending
those letters lest I should become insulted and you would have a security debt
you and I were liable for to pay</p>
<p>A: Mark went to see Rader unknown to me and after he came back he told me
what he had done, and said, &quot;If I were you I would have nothing to do with
it&quot; and I told him, I did not intend to, that I did not know what they were
going to do in the start and that I did not approve their course.</p>

<p>Case of Gotfrey Isaacs, No. 133,155</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this 27th day of June, 1884, at Chinquapin Rough, County of
Jackson, State of Ky, before me, A.C. Welch, a Special Examiner of the Pension
Office, personally appeared <b>Gotfrey Isaacs</b>, who being by me first duly
sworn to answer truly all interrogatories propounded to him during this special
Examination of afore said pension claim, deposes and says:</p>
<p>Q: Should it become necessary to examine your claim in any other locality do
you desire to be present in person or represented by attorney at such
examination.&nbsp; If so you will be notified of the time and place.</p>
<p>A: No, sir.&nbsp; I don't know that I do.</p>
<p>Q: Should you change your mind at any time and desire to be present at such
further examination will you&nbsp; at once write a letter to the Commissioner of
Pensions, Washington D.C. giving your name, and the number of your claim,
informing him that you have so changed your mind and desire to be notified when
your claim is to be further examined.</p>
<p>A: Yes sir.</p>
<p>Q: State the name of the person or persons and their post office addresses
instrumental in the prosecution of your claim for pension.</p>
<p>A: I believe M.C. Hughes of Green Hall, Jackson Co. was my first
attorney.&nbsp; He is dead.&nbsp; There might probably have been one at
Washington, D. C. but if there was I have forgotten his name and I don't know
whether there was one or not.&nbsp; These were on the original claim.&nbsp; In
my claim for increase John P. Harris at London, Ky and Gilmout&nbsp; Co. at
Washington D.C.&nbsp; In the original claim before I got it Bob Gibson of McKee,
Ky worked at it.</p>
<p>Q: State what contract or contracts you have made with any of such persons
for their services in prosecuting your claim for pension and whether such
contract or contracts were written or verbal.</p>
<p>A: I don't recollect what my contract with Mr. Hughes was, but I think it was
$10.&nbsp; He died before the claim was settled and Bob Gibson picked it up and
I don't recollect whether we made any contract.&nbsp; He did some writing.&nbsp;
My recollection at this&nbsp; time is that when the claim was allowed I paid
Gibson $5 and the administration of Hughes $5.&nbsp; I made a contract with Geo
E. Lemon of Washington D.C. through James Vance of McKee, for $10 in my claim
for restoration.</p>
<p>Q: State the amount of fees paid by you or by your instance, to whom paid,
and all the circumstances completed with the transactions.</p>
<p>A: I think I have paid $5 to the admin of M.C. Hughes, $5 to Bob Gibson and
$5 to Geo. E. Lemon of Washington D.C.&nbsp; I think it is in two amounts $3 and
$2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Have you been afforded full opportunity of being present in person or
represented by attorney during this examination</p>
<p>A: Yes sir.</p>
<p>Q: Have you been accorded a fair and impartial examination of your claim or
have you any complaint or charge to make against the Examiner.</p>
<p>A: I have had a fair examination and have no charge to make against the
Examiner.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any other witnesses you want to introduce in the Examination.</p>
<p>A: No, sir.&nbsp; Except Dr. Forster of London at whose examination I don't
care to be present.</p>
<p>Q: What is the date of the deed to your property about the payment for which
you and Mr. John Rader Sr. had a dispute</p>
<p>A: The 8th day of January, 1876, as you can see from the deed itself (handing
the deed)</p>
