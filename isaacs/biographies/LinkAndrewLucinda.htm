</p>
<p>Andrew Isaacs was born about 1819 to <a href="/isaacs/biographies/LinkGodfreyKeziah.htm"> Godfrey Isaacs and Keziah
Johnson</a>. He married 1st Mahaly
Lakes/Lax, daughter of <a href="/isaacs/biographies/LinkCarterLax.htm"> Carter Lakes/Lax and Edy
Skinner</a>, on 27 April 1840 in
Estill County.&nbsp; She must have died soon afterwards, because he married
Lucinda Carpenter 28 September 1841 in Laurel County.&nbsp; Lucinda was the
daughter of <a href="/isaacs/biographies/LinkStephenCarpenter.htm"> Stephen Carpenter and Nancy
Walker</a>.&nbsp; Andrew served during the
Civil War in Company A, 47th KY Volunteer (Mounted) Infantry as a 2nd
Lieutenant.&nbsp; He died on 2 September, 1863 in Jackson County of typhoid
fever, along with his father and mother and younger sister and brother, (see
Godfrey Isaacs and Keziah Johnson link, as well as the Godfrey and Lydia link.)&nbsp; Funeral services for Andrew were in the Annville Baptist
Church in Laurel County.&nbsp; Andrew is
buried in the Annville Cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Annville Cemetery is currently
called the Medlock Cemetery in Annville.</p>
<p>Lucinda Carpenter was born about 1824 in Floyd County, KY to Stephen
Carpenter and Nancy Walker.&nbsp; Stephen Carpenter is reported to have married
seven times.&nbsp; Nancy Walker was his first wife. Lucinda received a pension for Andrew's
CW service.&nbsp; She died 25 April 1873, in Jackson County.&nbsp; Two of her
children,&nbsp; Mary and Lydia were minors at the time of her death.&nbsp; Their uncle,
Godfrey Isaacs, was appointed their guardian.</p>
<p>The 1850 census for Andrew and Lucinda is confusing when compared to the 1860
census.&nbsp; The 1850 lists a daughter, Sarah, 7 years old.&nbsp; The 1860
lists a 15 year old daughter Kizza.&nbsp; I think these are the same
person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1850 also lists two daughters, Martha and Angeline
who do not appear on the 1860 census.&nbsp; I assume these children were deceased by 1860.</p>

<b>
1. Keziah Isaacs</b> was born 9 September 1844 in Laurel County.&nbsp; She married John
R. Casteel, the son of John Casteel and his 1st wife, Nancy Black, on 18 May 1868 in Jackson
County. John was born 28 January 1841.&nbsp; He enlisted as a Private in Co. C,
7th Kentucky Voluntary Infantry on the 19th of August 1861.&nbsp; He also served
in Co. D.&nbsp; At the time of enlistment his physical description was: height
-5'7&quot;; complexion -dark; eyes -dark;&nbsp; color of hair -dark.&nbsp; His
occupation was a farmer.&nbsp; John was mustered out as a Corporal on 11 March
1866. His pension was #157882.&nbsp; After leaving the service he lived in Moores Creek,&nbsp;
Jackson County&nbsp; in 1866.&nbsp; On&nbsp; March 15, 1893 he moved to Delaney,
Madison, Arkansas; in October 1909 he moved to Mountainburg, Crawford, Arkansas.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
John Casteel stated in his pension application that he married Jane
Seals in 1861, prior to
his marriage to Keziah Isaacs.&nbsp; According to his statement, John and Jane only
lived together for one day.&nbsp; He obtained a divorce from her, and &quot;we have never heard of her
since.&nbsp; Suppose she is dead.&nbsp; Court house has been burned and can't
get a record of divorce.&quot;&nbsp; John was mistaken, there is a record of his
divorce in Jackson County:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 Jackson County Court Records,<br>
Book 1, Nov Term 6th day, 1866 (Nov 17)<br>
p. 507: John Casteel, plff against Jane Casteel deft, judgment this cause came on from trial upon
the petition and proof and the court being adjudged and orders that the marriage contract between the
plaintiff and defendant be dissolved, set aside and held for naught and that the plaintiff be divorced from the defendant in
 ____ and that he be restored to all
the rights and privileges of an unmarried man.
</p>
<p>
On the Application for Reimbursement (pension papers)  filed by S L Casteel
[Samuel L.], age 45, relationship son, of Mountainburg, Crawford, Arkansas,
Samuel said his father's "last wife" (Cisias Isaacs) died Sept 1, 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He also said his father, John Casteel, became ill on 6 April 1915&nbsp; and he
died 24 April 1915 of
uremia at his [Samuel's] home in Mountainburg.&nbsp; John Casteel was buried in Pope Cemetery.
