<P>Jacob Alexander Robbins was the son of <a href="/isaacs/biographies/LinkMaryRobbins.htm"> Jonathan Robbins and Mary Masagee</a> or
Massingale.&nbsp; He was born 28 November 1824 in Randolph County, North
Carolina.&nbsp; He died 26 April 1867 at his
home in Jackson County, Kentucky, of  fever brought on by liver and kidney
ailments that he
felt were the result of his Civil War service. Jacob served as a Private in Co.
A, of the 47th KY infantry Volunteers.&nbsp; Jacob Alexander's Civil War
application for a pension based on disabilities was rejected.&nbsp; (See complete
copy of J.A. Robbins pension papers at the bottom of this
page.)&nbsp; I don't believe Jacob Alexander ever went by the name Jacob, he either used Alex,
or J.A. Robbins.&nbsp; In family records, I have most commonly seem him listed as J.A.
Robbins, and sometimes even A. J. Robbins.&nbsp; Although I knew the A. stood
for Alexander, it wasn't until I got his Civil War pension papers that I discovered his
first name was Jacob.&nbsp; I have seen Jacob Alexander mistakenly
referred to as Jason.&nbsp; Jacob Alexander Robbins married Matilda Lucinda Goldsmith on 12 October
1841 at the home of her brother, William Goldsmith in Buncombe County, North
Carolina.</P>

Matilda Lucinda Goldsmith was the daughter of <a href="/isaacs/biographies/LinkJohnGoldsmith.htm"> John Goldsmith and Elizabeth
Marshbanks</a>.&nbsp; She was born 28 July 1824 in Greenville, South Carolina and
according to family tradition, died 15
October 1903.&nbsp; According to the Civil War pension records, Matilda was
living in Jackson County, KY in 1890.&nbsp; She was dropped from the rolls due
to death as of 4 August 1901. She was supposedly living with her son in Oklahoma when she
died, but I haven't been
able to prove that either.&nbsp; I question whether she ever left
Kentucky.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>In the1820 census of
Greenville, SC,&nbsp; Matilda's father,  John Goldsmith was listed as having two sons and four daughters.
The Goldsmith family bought land in Buncombe County, North Carolina sometime in the 1820's
with the intent to homestead. (<i>Madison County Heritage, North Carolina Vol 1</i>, #279,
Goldsmith).  John died sometime before 1830 when Elizabeth Goldsmith was listed in
Buncombe County, NC. as the head of the household with two sons and seven daughters.
(The 1830 census lists males and females, I am assuming the relationship.) Since
John was buried in South Carolina, there is some question regarding whether he and Elizabeth
both moved to North Carolina, or if she and the children moved after his death.  On February 26<SUP>th</SUP>,
1832 (Yancey County Court Records)&nbsp; Elizabeth's two youngest
children were bound out.  "Matilda Goldsmith [age 10] is bound to Reuben Keith until she is
18.  He is to teach her the art and mysteries of industry.  John Goldsmith [age 8] is bound to
Reuben Keith until age 21.&quot;&nbsp; I think Reuben Keith might have been a
relative.&nbsp; His wife was Elizabeth Runnions, and Jacob Alexander Robbins'
sister Jane married Thomas Runions.&nbsp; I have yet to find a direct connection
between the two families.</p>
<p>According to her Civil War pension deposition, Matilda and Jacob Alexander had 13
children, four of whom were still born, one who predeceased her husband, (James
Wilburn who died 1862) and eight who were alive when her husband died.</p>
<P align="center"><b><font size="4">Children of Jacob Alexander Robbins and Matilda Lucinda
Goldsmith</font></b></P>

<P><b>1. Sarah Adeline Robbins</b> was born 8 August 1842 in Buncombe, North Carolina.  She married
Menitree Turner 23 June 1859 in McKee, Jackson, KY. Menitree was born
in Perry County. KY in about 1839 to John C.
Turner and Mary Pennington.(1850 Owsley pg. 284, 101/101)&nbsp; He served in Co.
C. 7th KY Infantry from 19 August 1861
until 24 February 1864.  He re-enlisted as a veteran and served in Co. D of the
same regiment until 11 March 1866.&nbsp; He was discharged at Baton Rouge, LA.&nbsp;
During the February 1872 term of the Jackson County Court, Minatree Turner was
appointed committee for Matilda L. Robbins.&nbsp; Sarah died 23 February 1883 in
Jackson County.

<b>
2. James Wilburn Robbins </b> was born in 1845 in Buncombe County, North Carolina.  He was underage when he 
enlisted at London, KY on the 1<SUP>st</SUP> day of November 1861 as a private in
Company A, 24 KY Infantry
Volunteers,
commanded by Col Grigsby Hurt.  He died on the 23<SUP>rd</SUP>  day of February 1862, after contracting
measles during his service.&nbsp; James never married.  Matilda Goldsmith
Robbins
eventually received a
pension benefit  based on her son's military service.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</P>

<P><b>3. Lemuel Turner Robbins</b> was born 30 September 1847 most likely in Clay County, KY.  He
married Rachael Turner on 23 Nov 1865.  Rachael was a sister to Menitree Turner, and a
daughter of John C. Turner and Mary Pennington. (1850 Owsley, pg. 284, 101/101).&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Rachael's
deposition of 10 October 1888, (for her mother-in-law's pension application) she said that she had not lived with Lemuel for 15 years.  In
Matilda Robbins' deposition of 4 October 1888, she said she didn't know if Lemuel were
alive or dead.  In his aunt's deposition for her widow's pension, (Abigail Ball) she
stated that
Lemuel was with her husband Addison when he was hurt during the war, but she doesn't
know where Lemuel is now because he "took off for parts unknown."</P>

<P> Rachel Turner was a widow when she married Lemuel Robbins.&nbsp; She had
previously married Hiram Casteel on 3 March 1859 in Jackson County.&nbsp;Rachel
and Hiram appear on the 1860 census of Jackson County (p. 847, 49/49.)&nbsp; Hiram was born about
1838, the son of John Casteel and his first wife Nancy Black.&nbsp; He was enrolled as a Private in
Co. C of the 7th KY Infantry of the Union Army on 19 August 1861 at London,
Kentucky, when he was 23 years old.&nbsp; He was demoted from Sgt to Pvt on the
28th of February 1862 &quot;on account of ill health.&quot; but he appeared to
have been &quot;Present for Muster (22 September 1861) 'til death.&quot;&nbsp; He died of measles
26 June 1863 at Black River Bridge in Mississippi.&nbsp;</P>

<P><b>4. Jonathan Goldsmith Robbins</b> was born 24 November 1849 in Clay County, KY.  He married Margaret
Gabbard 11 February 1873 in Jackson County, KY. Margaret was the daughter of
Ruben and Mary Gabbard. Jonathan died 14 March 1877 in Jackson County.&nbsp;
Margaret and her two children, Susan and Henry were living in Pond Creek,
Jackson County in 1880.&nbsp; Margaret married Joseph Reece 26 July 1883 in
Jackson County.</P>

<P><b>5. Wiley Marion Robbins</b> was born 5 October 1851 in Clay County, KY.  He married Mary E. Miracle
about 1872.</P>

<P><b>6. Mary Elizabeth Robbins</b> was born 5 October1853, in Clay County, KY.  This date is not a mistake,
according to Lucinda's pension application Mary and Wiley were both born on the 5<SUP>th</SUP> of
October, but two years apart.&nbsp; Mary Elizabeth married Isaac Isaacs, son of Andrew Isaacs and Lucinda Carpenter on 16
January 1869, in McKee, Jackson County, KY.  Mary died 10 September 1896 in Delany,
Madison County,
Arkansas, giving birth to twins.  The first twin, Mary Elizabeth was born alive, but the
second twin, an unnamed female, died.  Isaac Isaacs died 6 July 1930 in Oklahoma.</P>

<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>7. John Henry Robbins</b> was born 13 September 1855, in Clay
County, KY, and died 1 October 1886.  He married a
woman named Nancy.</SPAN>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>8. Nancy Jane Robbins</b> was born 30 May 1859 in Jackson
County, KY.  She married William Henley
Baldwin on 25 January 1875 in Jackson County. William Baldwin was born 19 March
1856 in Lee County, Virginia.&nbsp; He was the son of Rev. John R. Baldwin and
Margaret A. Howard.&nbsp; Marci (Baldwin) Judge, &lt;<a href="mailto:MarciJudge@aol.com">MarciJudge@aol.com</a>&gt;
a great granddaughter of William and Nancy Jane sent me this information:</SPAN></P>

<blockquote>
<P>William Henley Baldwin lived in Moore's Creek, KY (near Burnstad) as a child
and after his marriage to Nancy Jane Robbins, until about 1880 when Will and
Nancy Jane&nbsp; moved to Clay County.&nbsp; From KY they headed West in a
covered wagon to Columbus, MO, where they lived and worked for 3 months until
they had enough money and goods to travel on to Marshfield, again living and
working until they could afford to head out again.&nbsp; From there they moved
on to Seneca, working and preparing for the next move to the Cherokee Strip in
OK, where they rented land.&nbsp; After about 4 years they left and settled in
Falkner, KS.&nbsp; Apparently they didn't stay long and returned to OK living
for a spell in Tahlequah.&nbsp; At one point they joined their 2 covered wagons
to a train moving further West and stopped in Metgeesa, WY.&nbsp; From there
they travelled&nbsp; to and finally settling down on the Clearwater River near
Stites, ID.&nbsp; There were occasional moves for work purposes but the family
kept their home in Stites until Wm and Mary died.</P>

  <P align="left">According to Wanda Baldwin Welborn's records, Nancy Jane had
  told stories of how when Will and 'the boys' rode into town, people moved away
  quickly as they were well known to love a fight!!&nbsp; Will was a stonemason
  and carpenter by trade but apparently did not believe in formal education for
  his children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nancy Jane, however, was quite adept at reading,
  writing and mathematics and taught the children herself when she could not get
  them in school.&nbsp; He also was not a very 'warm' man and showed no love to
  his children.&nbsp; As they grew older and left home, they seldom saw him, but
  did visit their mother when he was gone, which apparently was quite often.&nbsp;
  It was reported by Wanda Baldwin Welborn that her father, Wm A,&nbsp;
  mentioned his father often disappearing into the mountain 'prospecting' for
  several months on end.&nbsp; During one such occasion Nancy Jane carried a
  child, delivered it and then had to bury it after it's short life span....all
  while he was off in the mountains.&nbsp; He did not believe in doctors,
  either, so she bore 14 of her 15 (3 still born) children by herself.&nbsp; The
  one time a doctor was called in was simply because they did not think she
  would live.</P>

</blockquote>

<P>William Henley Baldwin died 15 February 1937 and Nancy Jane Robbins Baldwin
died 8 June 1945.&nbsp; They were still living in Stites, Idaho County, Idaho at
the time of their deaths.</P>

had six children, Joseph, Matilda, Alexander, John Green., Mary A. and
Henry.&nbsp; Susanna died 17 Jan 1905 in Spokane, Washington.&nbsp; William is

<p>Case of Matilda L. Robbins, No. 172.712</p>
<p>On this <b>4<sup>th</sup> day of October 1888</b>, at Near Moore Creek,
County of Jackson, State of Kentucky, before me, James H. Clements, a Special
Examiner of the Pension Office, personally appeared <b>Matilda L. Robbins</b>,
who being by me first duly sworn to answer truly all interrogatories propounded
to her during this Special Examination of aforesaid pension claim, deposes and
says:</p>
<p>My age is 64 years, I have no occupation. I have no permanent home, reside
sometimes with my Son William A. Robbins and sometimes with a grandchild and
around among the neighbors. My P.O. address is Moore�s Creek, Jackson Ky. I am
____ and for a pension as the widow of&nbsp; Jacob A. Robbins, who died on a
place he had bought but was not able to pay for and it passed back into the
hands of the party from whom he bought it, Henry Alle. (Deed) It was about three
miles from where Moore�s Creek P.O. now is, on the 26 day of April 1867. I don�t
know what was the immediate cause of his death, but as well as I remember his
disease was said to be disease of liver and kidneys. For nine months before he
died, he was only able to go about the house and yard, totally unable to work he
did ride on house back a little bit as a recreation during that time. For twelve
weeks, before he died he could only get in and out of bed with assistance. His
symptoms were pain under left shoulder blade, left side and breast, and towards
the last of pain all over him. I don�t remember that he was troubled with his
bladder, or any difficulty in passing his water, or any excess in the flow of
urine, or want of control of urinary organs. My said husband had the pain in his
person, under left shoulder blade, side and breast at date of his discharge and
before that time. I know it because he came home on a sick furlough about the
last of July or first of August 1864 from Nicholasville, and he had the pains
described then. He told me that these pains first attacked him suddenly at
Nicholasville, KY when he was walking with his gun on his shoulder. He did not
give any cause for the origin of the pain. He had never been so troubled before
he enlisted. We were living on the Waters of Pond Creek, near Chinquapin Rough,
(now Annville) when he came home on furlough and when he enlisted. Mrs. Truitt
and Mrs.Cope had been to Nicholasville to see their sons who were in same
regiment with my husband, and he got his sick furlough while they were there,
they brought him home in their wagon. He was confined to bed for some
considerable time after he reached home and when the furlough expired he was
unable to go back to his command, said pains still troubling him. We got an
extension of his furlough from Dr. Foster at London, and Foster told him to use
a salt water sponge bath for the pains. I don�t remember whether Dr. Foster
gave him any medicine at that time, or while he was on furlough. I saw what he
called the furlough, but I can�t read or write. Sometime after the furlough
was extended his Captain wrote to him to come to Camp if possible to be mustered
out. I think he got a letter from his Captain, but I know he got a message from
his Captain telling him to come to camp to be mustered out. He did go back to
Camp on horseback and returned on same horse I think. He returned to Camp about
the first part of December 1864 and came back home discharged early in January
1865, he was still complaining of the pains referred to, but was not as bad off
as he was when he came home on sick furlough. Soon after he came home he
bargained for the piece of land I told you of, that he was never able to pay
for, and we moved on to it. He worked along some with assistance of our
children, but was never able to do much. I don�t remember that he had a Doctor
during the year immediately following discharge. I don�t remember that he was
laid up during the first years, but he was always complaining. He took pills
that he brought from the store, and made bitters of herbs that he gathered and
took them. About the first day of August 1866 he had been over on Pond Creek, to
see my daughter Sarah, wife of Menitree Turner, and he came home very sick and
went to bed. I was sick myself with chills and fever then, and when he came home
sick I asked him what was the matter, he replied that he was taken as he had
been at Nicholasville only worse. He called in Dr. John Ward at that time,
however was much better after that, but did get so he could get about some as I
stated before. I don�t know whether he had chills and fever when he came home
from said daughter�s. If he had any chills and fevers I don�t know it. He
sometimes complained of feeling chilly and cold but he had no shakes like I and
the children did, either when he came home from my daughters or afterwards. I
was sick nearly all the summer and fall, with chills and fever. Don�t know how
often Dr. Ward visited my husband, but I remember Dr. Farris was called in
December 1866 to see my husband. I don�t know whether my husband took quinine
or whether he took the same medicine I did. I remember that Mrs. Cynthia
McDowell, wife of Dr. William F. McDowell came to see us in the summer of 1866.
I don�t know whether she prescribed for me or my husband. Dr. McDowell is
dead, Mrs. Cynthia McDowell is still living. I believe she lives near where my
husband died. I reckon she practices medicine. I have heard of her practicing
medicine, but don�t know it as a fact. When Dr. Farris attended my husband in
December 1866 said husband was setting up, but bad off, he was very weak. I
asked the Doctor if he was going to give him any strong medicine, the reply was
that he was not, he told me what he was giving. I remember he mentioned several
things, but I only remember one by name, that was a brown colored powder, it was
a mixture he said it was Peruvian bark, it was mixed with water before taking.
Dr. John Ward only came to the house to treat my husband in August 1866, I
think, though he may have come after that. My daughter Sarah Turner is dead, her
husband Menitree Turner was in the Army when my husband visited Sarah in August,
no that is wrong, Menitree was at home. He is now living and his residence is in
Powell Co. near Clay City, but I think he is now visiting over a about -
Chinquapin Rough. Dr. Farris was the lst physician who visited said husband,. I
was married to deceased soldier October 12, 1841. I had thirteen children by
him, four of them were still born. I had a record of their births, but is was
burned about 16 years ago last February. Eight of said children were living when
my husband died. One of my children, James Wilburn Robbins, was a soldier in 24<sup>th</sup>

died were:</p>

<p>Hon John C. Black</p>
<p>Commissioner of Pensions</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>I have the honor to review the papers in claim orig no. 172.712 of Matilda L.
Robbins, widow of Jacob A. Robbins, late Private Co. A 47<sup>th</sup> KY Vol
Inf. P.O. address Moores Creek, Jackson Co. KY. Claim was originally filed Mar
10, 1859, alleging death of soldier April 26, 1867 from disease in sides,
contracted in service and line of duty, Adjutant General report shows no disease
or disability in service, soldier was mustered out with his Co. The claim was
rejected June 11, 1877. Reopened May 12, 1888 and referred to SED June 27, 1888
for Special Examination to immediate cause of death, and general merit. It was
taken up by me on 4 int. because other work made &quot;Special&quot; by order of
the Hon Commissioner took me to same neighborhood in which claimant and some of
her witnesses resides.</p>
<p>Claimant is a very poor woman, of good reputation, she has no education, but
is intelligent, has apparently a very good memory, though it is a fault
sometimes. She was duly notified of intended examination, and informed of all
her rights and privileges. She waived delay, and personal presence, but was
represented by her agent, Wm B. Johnson, who was present during the examinations
of each witness appearing before me except Dr. John Ward, all the testimony was
read over to claimant in his presence and hearing before taking her final
statement.</p>
<p>The witnesses examined by me are of fair to good reputation, all are friendly
to claimant, indeed all persons to whom I mentioned her case, who knew her,
expressed a hope that she would be pensioned. Dr. J. P. Farris who attended the
soldier after discharge from service, in the sickness that in my opinion was the
primary cause of his death, is a very old man, he has no education, but has
practiced as a Doctor in Jackson Co., KY for over 40 years, his reputation for
truth is good. It appears that a number of affidavits filed in the brief jacket,
purposing to have been signed by said Doctor John Ward, are forgeries but
prosecution has long been barred by the statute, and the Agent who had the case
in hand at time the forgeries were committed, has been dead some years.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cynthia McDowell, who succeeded said Ward in the treatment of the soldier
an original witness, and who was examined by me, is a woman of good reputation.
She still practices as a Doctor among a respectable class of poor people. I am
satisfied her statement to me in this claim is substantially true.</p>
<p>From the testimony before me filed herewith, I am of opinion that the soldier
was not a strong man before enlistment, was predisposed to liver complaint. He
was indisposed to some extent, and doctored himself while in service, but had no
serious sickness therein. After discharge he followed his usual avocation of
farming and preaching., and complained some of pains and aches, but had no
serious sickness until about August or September 1866, when he with several
members of his family were attached with bilious intermittent fever, or chills
and fevers, from local causes. His treatment was of a primitive character, but
he improved under it and got up and about, but went to traveling around
preaching before he was sufficiently strong, and in consequence had a relapse
resulting in a general breaking down, such as frequently attends or follows
malarial disease and from which he died. It is very probably that his liver and
kidneys were affected, as sworn to by P. A. Faris. Exhibit 89 BJ/ I do not
believe the disease that caused his death was contracted in Service and
therefore recommend that the claim be rejected.</p>
<p>There is with the papers an application from claimant, filed October 12,
1888, for pension as dependent mother of James Wilburn Robbins. Private Co. A 24
KY Infty, Vols. Who died in the service Feb 3, 1862, at Bardstown, KY, but is
has never been considered or numbered. I did not deem it my duty under the
circumstances to take testimony as to dependence, but from what is developed in
this examination I think there is merit in the mother�s claim, and as she is
extremely poor, I take the liberty to suggest an early consideration of that
claim, should my recommendation be approved in this.</p>
