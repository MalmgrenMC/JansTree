and Susan Bowman</font></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P>Fielding Isaacs was born about 1816 to <a href="/isaacs/biographies/LinkSamuelNancy.htm"> Samuel Isaacs and Nancy
Baldridge</a>.&nbsp; Fielding married Susan Bowman, the daughter of
Jacob Bowman and Elander Evans.&nbsp; Susan was born about 1816.&nbsp; I found
two marriage bonds for the marriage of Fielding Isaacs and Susan Bowman in Clay
County.&nbsp; The first bond was dated 9 January 1830.&nbsp; The second was
dated 12 January 1835:</P>

<P>Mr. Ab Baker, Sir -- You will plese to issue lisens to Feelen Isaac and my
dater Susan Bowman and you will oblige your friend. Elendor Bowman.&nbsp;
Witnesses: Samuel Isaac &amp; Edward Evens. Fielding Isaacs paid the bond of
$1.35</P>

<P> The first county record date of 9 January 1830 would make Fielding and Susan both
13 or 14, depending on their respective birthdays.&nbsp; In the second county
record Fielding and Susan would be 18 or 19.&nbsp; Susan said in her Civil
War deposition of 13 Nov 1884 that she was 18 when she
married.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that their first child was born in November of 1835
would seem to support a marriage date of 1834 or 1835 rather than 1830.&nbsp;They
were the parents of ten
children.&nbsp;</P>

<P>Fielding Isaacs was listed on the 1840 census of Madison County as a male
between 20-30.&nbsp; Susan was listed as a female between the ages of
20-30.&nbsp; They had two sons, ages 0-5.&nbsp; Fielding was listed on the
Owsley County tax rolls from 1844 through 1848.&nbsp; Susan Isaacs was listed
twice in the Elk Lick Baptist Church records.</P>

<blockquote>
  <P>October 1843 - Received by experience and baptism: ... Susan Isaac</P>

  <P>June 1844 - Brother Elijah Isaacs caste forward and let the church know the
  hurt between him and Susan Isaac. The church is satisfied.</P>

</blockquote>

<P> Elijah Isaacs was Susan's brother in law.&nbsp; Unfortunately, whoever was keeping
the church minutes didn't make a record of what the particular hurt was.&nbsp;</P>

<P> In 1850 Fielding and Susan were living in Estill County.&nbsp; In 1860 they
were living in the newly formed (1858) Jackson County. They probably hadn't
moved, since part of Jackson was made up of the southern part of Estill County.</P>

<P>Susan applied for a mother's pension for the Civil War service of her son Jasper who died during the
conflict.&nbsp; According to her deposition,&nbsp;
she divorced Fielding after he deserted her and left the family destitute while their youngest child, Andrew,
was still a baby.&nbsp;Susan's divorce suit was dated 12 March 1863 and it
was filed 16 March 1863.&nbsp; In June 1865 the court recorded the alimony and
property division between Susan and Fielding.</P>

<blockquote>

later.</P>

under execution of the circuit court in favor of Susan Isaacs against Fielding
Isaacs.&nbsp; [She got 150 acres which was bid off to J. Spivy for $93.00.]</P>

</blockquote>

<P>  Family tradition is that Fielding was a mean person, who was not only
abusive to his wife, but also abusive towards his mother Nancy.  As a result, many in the
family would have nothing to do with him. Oral family histories maintain that Fielding
was also a womanizer.  The court records of Jackson County and testimonies of
neighbors seem to support Fielding's history of&nbsp; troublesome conduct and womanizing.</P>

<P><i><b>Civil War Pension Application Depositions regarding Fielding:</b></i></P>

<P>Jeremiah Sparks deposition on the 14th of November 1884 regarding a pension for Susan
Isaacs on behalf of her son Jasper who died during the war:</P>

<blockquote>

<P>Question:  Tell us the date and circumstances of Fielding's abandonment of
claimant</P>

<P>Answer:   I could not give the date - Ever since I knew him, he has been running off with
women and coming back and abusing his wife, I have seen him running about with women
all along before the war.  He has a family by Vicey Johnson and the rumor is that he has
raised  a family by Vicey's child and also by his own child the daughter of Vicey.  He had
children by Mary Stevens and Nancy Stevens before the war, I think that he practically
abandoned Susan his wife before the war and wasted his substance on other women.</P>

</blockquote>

<P>Nancy Vance deposition on the 13th of November 1884 regarding a pension for Susan Isaacs
on behalf of her son Jasper who died during the war: [Nancy Harrison Vance is
the daughter of George Harrison and Rachel Isaacs.&nbsp; Since Rachel was Fielding's
older sister, Nancy was a 1st cousin to Wilburn and Darius, etc.]</P>

<blockquote>

<P>Question:  Where was her [Susan's] husband? [when the boys got home from the
war]</P>

<P>Answer:  I don't remember whether he was about there then or not.  I don't think that they
lived together as man and wife any after her last child was born.  I know when it was quite a
small child she came here to town, badly bruised and she said that he had struck her on the
head.  Her head was badly bruised and her eyes blackened.  When the boys were mustered
out in 1864, I went there with Wilborn and Darius the two boys that came back from the
army [Jasper died during the war and although Cornelius came home at the same
time, he was married and probably went to his own home rather than his mother's]&nbsp; and the old man was standing in the yard.  He and his wife did not speak at that time.  I
don't think that he was staying there then.  His horse was hitched to the fence
and I think that
he had come there from another place.  My best recollection is that he was said to be staying
with a woman named Collins at that time.  I don't think that he had been contributing any to
the support of his family for a good while.  I think that he was taking  away from them.  I
don't know many facts of my personal knowledge, but his treatment of his wife was common
told and every body knew it.   I know of my own knowledge that he had a woman named
Johnson and raised a family of children by her.  This was before the year 1863.</P>

<P><i><b>Correspondence regarding Fielding:</b></i></P>

<P>The following is from a letter from Charlotte Perry of Oklahoma written to
Aaron T. Isaacs.</P>

<blockquote>

<P>There is a Alma Lockard of Oregon whose grandfather Vincent M. Stephens, born
1858 in Jackson Co., his brother, James Buchannan Stephens, born 1856 and his
sister Sarah Ellen Stephens born 1855 who married Wm. Arvine, are said to have
been the illegitimate children of one Fielding Isaacs and her great grandmother
Mary Jane Stephens who later married Hiram Lunsford and had a family by
him.&nbsp; She can find no documentation so is hoping she can find someone who
had heard the story, that has been passed down in this particular Isaacs family.</P>

</blockquote>

<P>Many family traditions list Fielding's death between 1860 and 1870.&nbsp;
Some claim he died during the Civil War.&nbsp; It is probably only wishful thinking on
their part.&nbsp; Fielding was alive and well in 1870 living in Garrard County
with an 18 year old named Jenny Johnson.&nbsp; He was living in Wayne County in 1880,
still with Jenny. &nbsp;</P>

<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Children of Fielding and Susan Bowman</font></b>
<p><b>1. Cornelius &quot;Neal&quot; M. Isaacs</b> was born 24 November1835.&nbsp; He married
Margaret Pigg on 6 June 1855 in Owsley County.
Margaret Pigg was the daughter of Milton and Mary Pigg.&nbsp; She was born 16
March 1836 and died 3 June 1919 in Estill County.&nbsp; During the Civil War
Cornelius served in
Co. D, 7<SUP>th</SUP> KY Infantry.&nbsp;
He applied for an invalid pension 13 March 1880 (certificate #297690).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the family that Cornelius had with his wife Margaret, it is
believed that he also had an illegitimate son with a woman named Naomah
Brewer.&nbsp; In the Jackson County court records of October 1876, pg. 71:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ordered by the court that Dillard Brewer, infant child of Omea Brewer
deceased, above 2 years old be allowed the sum of forty-seven dollars and that
Mrs. Susan Isaacs be his committee and that she take charge of said child and
that she be required to treat him humanely.</p>
<p>It is ordered by the court that a claim of six dollars heretofore allowed
Susan Isaacs for taking care of and keeping an infant child of Omea Brewer,
decd, 3 months, be placed on the list of claims for 1877 and that the sheriff
pay the same out of the first county funds that come into his hands for sd year
1877.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The child, Dillard Brewer, was listed as Dillard Isaacs and living with Susan
Isaacs when the 1880 census was taken.&nbsp; Naomah Brewer was listed on the
1870 census of McKee, Jackson County, pg 210, 35/35 with three children, Hughs
8, Sarah C. 3, and Willliam D. 11/12's.</p>
<p>Cornelius died 7
March 1904 at Station Camp Creek, Estill County of drowning. He is buried in
the Wilson Cemetery on the David Newton Farm in Estill County.&nbsp; Margaret A.
Isaacs, widow, received a widow's pension (certificate&nbsp; #579248).</p>

<p>Excerpts
from Wilburn's pension application:</p>
<p><br>
Wilburn B. Isaacs<br>
Enrolled at Booneville, KY, 19 August 1861<br>
Mustered-in at Camp Dick Robinson [Garrard Co., KY], 22 September 1861<br>
Company D, Age 21 years<br>
Mustered-out at Louisville, KY, 5 October 1864<br>

was subsequently redesignated the 7th KY Volunteer Infantry.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<br>
Deposition A<br>
<br>
Case of Wilburn B. Isaacs, No. 283,113<br>
<br>
On this Sixth day of January 1886, at Near Waco, County of Madison, State of Ky, before me, J. F. Allison, a Special Examiner of the Pension Office,
personally appeared Willburn B. Isaacs clt. [claimant], who being by me first duly sworn to answer
truly all
interrogatories propounded to him during this Special Examination of afore-said pension
claim, deposes and says:  his age is 46 years occupation farmer Post Office address
Waco, Madison Co., Ky. am clt. in this case.&nbsp; I claim a Pension for GSW
[gun shot wound] right heel and
left ankle recd at the battle of Richmond Ky. about the 1st Sep 62.   I also recd a slight
wound in my left arm which does not disable me. There was only about 90 men of our&nbsp;
Regt present in the action.  They were commanded by Col. Garrard in the morning and
later in the day by Major I. N. Cardwell and later by Cap. A. H. Clark.  [Andrew H.
Clark, Co. D; later Col. of the 47th KY Vol.Mtd. Inf.]  The balance of our Regt were left
at Cumberland Gap Ky.  About 1/3 of the members of my Co. were engaged in the Richmond battle as near as I
recollect.  there might have been 20 or 25 men present.&nbsp; My Co. was first engaged about 8 or 9
o'clock in the morning.  about one
hour afterwards we were ordered to our horses and there we mounted and retreated in order through
Richmond.  About night the Federal forces were surrendered by General Manson.  My
Co. then began to scatter, each man for himself.  I was wounded about the time of the
surrender.  The following list of comrades were with me when I was wounded to wit:
Wilburn Bowman, D. G. Isaacs dead [1871 KY], Preston Isaacs knew of it when I was on my way
home, he is dead [1864 TN].  I stayed at a house on station camp by the name of Wedges [?]
house.  I don't recollect anything about who lived there.  I don't know whether anyone
there had a knowledge of my wounds or not.  I remained at home about three months as&nbsp;
near as I can guess it.  Then joined my Regt at Cincinnati O.  Was there in pretty good
shape, did regular duty - was not much lame.  It was not generally known in the Co.
when I returned that I was wounded, it was not talked about.  Unless a man was badly
wounded it was not talked about.  My most intimate comrades and tent mates were, Paul
Pigg, dead, Preston Pigg his bro, dead, P. M. Murphy dead [1863 MS], James
Lanehart,
dead [1863 MO], Green
Harrison, dead [1863 MS], and my brother Jasper Isaacs, dead [1863 LA].  After I rejoined my&nbsp; Regt.
again I did not complain I just went on with my duty.  I don't recollect that my comrades
who were present with the Co. when I joined it at Cin. O. were present with me in the
Battle of Richmond.  I done regular duty with my Co. after I rejoined it at Cin. O. except
when I was sick.  I don't know whether we had a Surgeon with us in the Richmond battle
or not.  The reason why I can not furnish more evidence of neighbors at the time I
was home wounded is because: the vicinity of my home was full of retreating bushwhackers
and Rebels and the citizens did not
stir about much.  There was very little visiting done.  I hid out one third of the time I was at
home, dare not stay in the house at night.  The only person who has any knowledge of the fact that I came home wounded
from the Richmond battle in addition to the evidence already taken by Spl. Ex. Rice is
My Mother Susan Isaacs of McKee Jackson Co. Ky.   I am unable to furnish the evidence of any Officer or Comrade to show that
my ankles and feet were free from the scars they now bear: at any time subsequent to my enlistment and prior to the Richmond
battle.  I am also unable to furnish the evidence of any Officer or Comrade showing
that I had those scars on my feet or ankles after the Richmond battle and prior to my
discharge other than that already furnished.  Col. A. H. Clark of Booneville Ky. J. F.
Herd and A. J. Herd &amp; Judge S. [Sylvester] Isaacs were intimate associates with me at and just
prior to my enlistment in the service.  they were neighbors and intimate associates of
mine from 1850 till enlistment.  Since the Service I have been 2/3 disabled each year on
account of those wounds.  I have not suffered from the results of any serious accident or
illness since the Service.&nbsp;<br>

<p><i><b>Susan Isaacs Civil War Pension application deposition:</b></i></p>
<p><i>On this thirteenth day of November 1884 at Susan Isaacs home, County of
Jackson, State of Kentucky, before me, William W. Didwick, a Special Examiner of
the Pension Office, personally appeared Susan Isaacs, Claimant, who being by me
first duly [sworn is crossed out and the word requested in put in its place]
requested to answer truly all interrogatories propounded to her during this
Special Examination of afore said pension claim, says:</i></p>
<p>I am the claimant in this claim, My age is about 73 years to the best of my
knowledge.&nbsp; I reside in Jackson County, Kentucky.&nbsp; My post office is
McKee, Jackson County Kentucky.</p>
<p><i>Please state where you were born and give the place and date of your
marriage and where you have lived since your marriage.</i></p>
<p>I was born near Boonville, Owsley Co. Kentucky. I was married to Fielding
Isaacs at Boonville, Kentucky when I was eighteen years old.&nbsp; I have lived
since my marriage first at Birch Creek five miles above Boonville, Ky.&nbsp; I
lived there until I had 4 or 5 children.&nbsp; Then at Birch Lick in Jackson Co.
Ky. I lived there about three years.&nbsp; I then moved here, and have lived
here forty years or more.</p>
<p><i>How many children have you had and what are their names &amp; ages?</i></p>
<p>I have had nine.&nbsp; The oldest is Cornelius M., Wilburn next, then Darius,
then Jasper, then Alfred, then James, then Margaret, then Elisha, then Andrew
who is the youngest. [When the examiner copied Susan's family bible, she had 10
children listed, including a daughter Nancy who lived less than two years.]</p>
<p><i>Where are all those children now?</i></p>
<p>Cornelius lives in this county.&nbsp; Wilburn lives in Madison Co Ky.&nbsp;
Darius is dead.&nbsp; He died here Feby 16th, 1871.&nbsp; Jasper died in the
army. Alfred lives in Tennessee.&nbsp; James is in Arkansas.&nbsp; I don't know
where Margaret is, the last I heard of her she was in Illinois.&nbsp; Elisha
lives in this county and Andrew lives with me.&nbsp; All the above children are
married.</p>
<p><i>Do you know the dates when the above children married?</i></p>
<p>No sir I don't.&nbsp; Cornelius and Wilburn both have grown children.&nbsp;
Cornelius has three married children.&nbsp; Wilburn's oldest child is seventeen
or eighteen year old.&nbsp; Alfred's oldest child is about eight years and James
oldest child is about 10 or 11 years old.&nbsp; Margaret married in 1868 or 1869
I think.&nbsp; Elisha married about eight years ago and Andrew married about
three years ago.</p>
<p><i>How long did your said children live with you and contribute to your
support?</i></p>
<p>They lived with me until they got grown, and then they struck out for
themselves.&nbsp; Wilburn did not live with me any after he came out of the
army.&nbsp; Darius went off and worked until he was taken sick with
consumption.&nbsp; He then came home and made one crop before he died.&nbsp;
Andrew has lived with me all the time and still lives with me.</p>
<p><i>How about your husband, did he not contribute to your support or rather
support you at that time?</i></p>
<p>No Sir. No more than just bread.&nbsp; He never provided any clothing, shoes,
coffee nor nothing else except bread. He would make the boys make corn enough
for bread, but he would pack half of it away to his woman.&nbsp; I never dared
to touch any of his coffee.&nbsp; He carried it in his saddle bag locked
up.&nbsp; He never permitted me to cook for him.&nbsp; I lived in the kitchen
and he in the big house.&nbsp; He never gave me any money nor clothing nor
provided any clothing for the children.&nbsp; He ceased providing for me or the
children some time before he left except the corn that the children made.</p>
<p><i>Didn't you have sheep and hogs on the place?</i></p>
<p>Yes sir, but they didn't do us much good until after he left. He would not
even let us shear the sheep nor pick up a tag of wool.&nbsp; He kept selling the
hogs until I stopped him in court.</p>
<p>How much of his time did your husband stay here and how much did he work on
the farm in 1863?</p>
<p>He did not stay here at all then and had not worked any of the farm for
several years before that.&nbsp; He quit doing any work here three or four years
before the war.&nbsp; In 1863 he was living in Madison County, I think, It may
have been 1864 or 1865 that he lived in Madison County.&nbsp; When I commenced
the suit he was living with a woman named Collins in this county.</p>
<p><i>How much is your entire property worth, land and every thing else?</i></p>
<p>I have generally ____ in the farm at $200 &amp; $250. Outside the farm I only
have a cow, six sheep. I have no horse or mule.&nbsp; My mule died, the one that
I bought with Jasper's Bounty.</p>
<p><i>Have you any money in the Bank or bonds?</i></p>
<p>Not that I ever heard of.</p>
<p><i>Don't you make anything but corn?</i></p>
<p>No sir - sometimes Andy sows a little wheat. We all have lived off the crop.
I hoe corn &amp; do all kinds of work on the farm.&nbsp; I make all the clothing
for myself and grandchildren.&nbsp; I have nobody with me now, but Andy's
children and the little orphan boy whom I took to help me.</p>
<p><i>What is your yearly income?</i></p>
<p>Not much, we only make enough to eat. Never have any thing to sell. I manage
to get money enough some way to pay the taxes, they generally amount to $1.50 or
$2.00 per year.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp; see $5.00 in money in a year.&nbsp; I sold a
bushel of dried apples the other day for 85 cents in funds.&nbsp; I got some
cakes and thread to weave my lindsey.&nbsp; We never have sugar on the
table.&nbsp; All the groceries we buy is coffee.&nbsp;</p>
