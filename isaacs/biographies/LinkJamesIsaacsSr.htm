<p> James Isaacs was born about 1804, probably in Virginia.&nbsp; He was the son
of <a href="/isaacs/biographies/LinkSamuelNancy.htm"> Samuel Isaacs and Nancy Baldridge</a>.&nbsp; He was first
married in Perry County, KY.&nbsp; However, Perry County has suffered two major
natural disasters and the only book left with early marriages is one that lists
only the groom and the name of the man who performed the marriage.&nbsp; We
don't know the name of James Isaacs' first wife.&nbsp; The Perry County Marriage Book states, &quot;21 August 1823 � James
Isaacs married by John Morris&quot;</p>
<p> James Isaacs was listed on the 1830 census of Clay County with his wife
(both between 20 and 30) and two daughters and a son under five.</p>
<p>
James married a 2nd time on 22 August 1847 in Madison County to Mrs. Elizabeth
Davis.&nbsp;James and Elizabeth combined two large families, although it seems
Elizabeth left most of her older children in Laurel County with family and
friends.&nbsp;The Laurel County Court records list some of the Davis children
and with whom they were living.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Laurel County Court, November term, 1843, p. 305</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It has come to the attention of the court that Elizabeth Davis is the mother of
certain orphan children in this county and that she is not in a condition to
support and raise said children in comfort and she has an obligation that the
same children should be bound to some useful ____ [can't read].</p>
<p>
1. Joseph Davis, age 3 [on] 27 December 1843, bound to Isaac Forbes to be taught
farming.<br>
2. James Davis, age 5&nbsp; [on]15 October 18__ [can't read], bound to William Mardis to
be taught farming<br>
3. Polly Davis, about 7 to [I think it is Henderson Davis, but it is very
difficult to read] to be taught housewifery<br>
4. Susan Davis, about 9 to James Davis to be taught housewifery<br>
5. Martha Davis about 11 to John Forbs to be taught housewifery</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The 1850 Madison County census taker did not distinguish between Isaacs and
Davis children, and as a consequence, it has been difficult to identify the
various family members.&nbsp; The 1860 census provided some clarification, however,
as it often happens with research, more questions surfaced than were answered.</p>
<p>
During the November 1858 term of the Jackson County Circuit Court John Clemons
was indicted for malicious stabbing.&nbsp; James Isaacs, whose son James R.
married John Clemons daughter, Mary Jane a year earlier, put up the bond for John Clemons'
bail.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Commonwealth of Kentucky, plaintiff, against John Clemmons, defendant -
  Malicious stabbing</p>
  <p>This day came the attorney for the Commonwealth and the defendant in person
  on motion of the attorney for the plaintiff, it is ordered that this cause be
  continued until next term, the defendant being in custody and admitted for
  bail. James Isaacs came personally into court and acknowledged himself
  indebted to the commonwealth of Kentucky in the sum of two hundred and fifty
  dollars to be void however upon condition that the said John Clemmons appear
  in this court of the first day of the next term....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 17th of January, 1859, Samuel Isaacs, the oldest son of James Isaacs
was murdered.&nbsp; During the June 1859 session of the circuit court, the Grand
Jury issued an indictment against James R. Isaacs for manslaughter. James R.
Isaacs was found guilty of manslaughter during the November 1859 term of the
Circuit Court and John Clemons' case was continued.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the same
session of court (November 1859) James Isaacs Sr. and his son George W. Isaacs
were indicted for murder.&nbsp; John Clemons' case, as well as the cases of
James Isaacs Sr. and George W. Isaacs were continued until the next session.
(The Circuit Court met every June and November.)&nbsp; It is interesting to note
that
during the November 1859 term, John Clemons submitted a bill to the Commonwealth
for $3.75 for guarding James R. Isaacs.&nbsp; The invoice was verified and
paid.&nbsp;&nbsp; The indictments against John Clemons, and James and George W.
Isaacs were continued during each succeeding session of court until the June
term, 1862 when the case against James Isaacs Sr. was discontinued due to his
death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>June term, 1862:&nbsp; Commonwealth against James and George Isaacs
  --&nbsp; it appearing to the satisfaction of the court that James Isaacs is
  dead therefore it is ordered that this cause abate so far as concerns James
  Isaacs, and that the defendant George W. Isaacs recognizance be respited and
  that the witness of plaintiff recognizance be respited and that the cause be
  continued until the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the next term of this court and this
  cause is continued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the November term, 1863 the indictment against John Clemons was
dismissed.&nbsp; There was no additional&nbsp; information given in the court
records.&nbsp; George W. Isaacs' case was continued during every court session
until the November term, 1867.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Commonwealth, plaintiff against G. W. Isaacs, defendant</p>
  <p>The defendant G. W. Isaacs appeared in discharge of his recognizance and
  also produced and filed in this court a pardon for the offence charged from
  the Governor Thomas E. Bramlette, and the court being fully advised of the
  governship of said pardon, it is ordered that said defendant be discharged and
  go hence without delay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know the relationship of all these events to one another.&nbsp; I
guess it is possible that they are isolated incidents, but that supposition
seems to strain credulity.</p>
<p>The court records indicate that James Isaacs Sr. died prior to June
1862.&nbsp; His heirs were listed
several times in various land records and other probate actions.</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Children of James Isaacs</font></b></p>
<p align="left">I have listed the children that seem obviously to belong to one
wife with that wife.&nbsp; There were some children who appeared on
the 1850 or 1860 census who were difficult to place; as well as some individuals listed as heirs on the deeds that
I cannot place.&nbsp; A discussion of those
children appears after the list of the children of James Isaacs and Elizabeth Davis.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Children of James Isaacs and his first wife</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>1. Samuel Isaacs</b> was born about 1826 in Clay
County.&nbsp; He married Jane Johnson the daughter of Herod Johnson and
Elizabeth Isaacs on 16 September 1847 in Madison County.&nbsp; The marriage bond was dated 15
September 1847 with Fielding Isaacs as
bondsman and Elizabeth Johnson as the mother of the bride. James Isaacs and Elizabeth Isaacs Johnson were
siblings, so Samuel and Jane were first cousins.</p>
<p>Samuel was listed as the husband of Jane Johnson in the Floyd County Land
records concerning her deceased father's estate.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>E-635, 27 Oct 1847 -&nbsp; Herod Johnson�s wife and heirs of Madison County on one
  part, and William Hall of Floyd County on the other. Elizabeth Johnson and
  Heirs of Herod Johnson for $600.00, sell 200 acres on the right fork of Beaver
  Creek to William Hall. Wit: John B. Harrison and Wm Isaacs, Sr.</p>
  <p>Signed: Samuel Isaacs and wife Jane, daughter of Herod Johnson, Elizabeth
  Johnson, Elisha Johnson, Amy Johnson, Lewsy Johnson, Rachel Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"> Samuel and Jane had two
daughters, Elizabeth Jane, born 13 December 1849, who appeared with her parents on the 1850
Madison County census and Lavina whose
birth was recorded in the Madison County Vital Records, &quot;Lavina Isaacs born January 1853 in
Madison to Samuel Isaacs Jr. and Jenny Johnson.&quot;&nbsp; Jane's death was also
recorded in the Madison County Vital Records, &quot;Died 3 October 1853, Jenny Isaacs,
married, age 30, of
consumption.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Samuel married 2nd Elizabeth Harrison, daughter of John B.
Harrison and Sarah Brockman, on 6 March 1854 (bond)&nbsp; in Madison County with John B. Harrison, giving consent.&nbsp; They
had three children, James B. born in June 1855; Sarah born in 1857; and Samuel Preston
born 23 August 1859 (Jackson County Vital Records).</p>
<p align="left">Samuel's death date was listed in the Vital Records of Jackson County
as 17 January 1859 with the notation that he was murdered.&nbsp;The Adams County 
Sentinel, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 21 January 1859, gave this account the the 
event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">A Bloody Fight in Kentucky - A terrible fight occurred in McKee, 
the county seat of Jackson, Ky., on Monday week, which resulted in the death of 
two of the parties concerned.&nbsp; Samuel Isaacs was killed on the ground, and John 
Morris died the day after.&nbsp; A son of John Morris was also nearly cut to pieces, 
but is not yet dead.&nbsp; Several other were more or less injured.&nbsp; A feud has for a 
long time existed between the Morisses and Isaacs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Samuel's brother James R. was indicted for murder in June 1859.&nbsp; 
He was sent to prison for two years. The actual court records of the trial no 
longer exist but it it seems likely that these two events are related. Samuel's death left his first two
children, Elizabeth Jane and Lavina without either parent.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Jackson County Court Records: March 1859 p. 94:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">On the motion of James Isaacs ordered that he be appointed
  guardian of Elizabeth and Vina Isaacks, infant orphans of Samuel Isaacks decd,
  whereupon he took the oath required by law and together with Cornelius Isaacs,
  entered into and acknowledged covenant with constitution according to law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">&nbsp;In 1860
Elizabeth Jane was living in Jackson County with her mother's brother, Elijah
Johnson (p. 843, 22/22) and Lavina was listed as Lavinah Isaacks and was living with her maternal grandmother,
Elizabeth Isaacs Johnson Tillery (p. 866, 181/181) also in Jackson County.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Jackson County Court Records: Feb. 1863 p. 323:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Elizabeth Isaacs is appointed guardian for the infant heirs of
Samuel Isaacs decd.&nbsp; [The action actually only included Samuel and
Elizabeth's children. It did not pertain to either of Samuel's daughters with
Jane Johnson.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">All five of Samuel's children were listed in Jackson County Court Records as
defendants in a suit brought by Philip Marcum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>2. Lucinda Isaacs </b> was born about 1828 in Clay
County.&nbsp; She had several children before her marriage on 28 November 1867
in Jackson County to John Richmond.&nbsp; Her brother, James R. was the
bondsman.&nbsp;&nbsp;John and Lucinda Richmond were in Jackson County in 1870
and in Rockcastle County in 1880.</p>
<p align="left"><b>3. Louisa Isaacs</b> was born about 1829 in Clay County.&nbsp; She
apparently married Jesse Johnson sometime around 1858, but I can't find a marriage
record.&nbsp; Jesse and Louisa appeared on the 1860 census with a one year old
daughter, Esther.&nbsp; The older children in the household are probably Jesse's
children from a pervious marriage.&nbsp; During the June 1866 term of the
Jackson County Circuit Court, Jesse and Louise Johnson were charged with failing
to appear to file a deposition regarding a suit filed by John Stephens against
James Isaacs Sr.'s heirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Proof made to the satisfaction of the court that Jesse Johnson
and wife Louisa Johnson are non residents, the defendants Jesse Johnson and
Louisa Johnson are warned to appear in the Jackson Circuit Court on the first
day of its next November term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Louisa and her daughter Esther (born about 1858/9) were living
in Travellers Rest, Owsley County in 1870, but Jesse was not included in the
household. I don't know if he was deceased or just moved on. Louisa was listed as a heir to her father in probate actions in 1865 and 1874.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;<b>4. Lewatty Isaacs</b> was born about 1831 in Clay County.&nbsp; She
married Joseph A. Isaacs son of Samuel ( 1794-1859) and his wife Sarah, on 17 July 1854
in Madison.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Samuel was a
brother to James, Lewatty and Joseph A. were first cousins.&nbsp; Joseph died
before 1860, when Lewatty was listed alone with her children on the 1860 census.&nbsp;
On 22 June 1861, Lewatty married Isaac Harrison, the son of George Harrison and
Rachel Isaacs.&nbsp; Since Rachel Isaacs Harrison was a sister of James Isaacs, Lewatty
and Isaac Harrison were also first cousins.&nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac Harrison appeared
on the 1860 census living with his mother.&nbsp; However, he might have
been married before his marriage to Lewatty.&nbsp; The Madison County Vital Records
listed the birth of a Rachel Harrison to Isaac Harrison and Mary Blanton on 15
Feb 1856.&nbsp;During the June 1863 term of the Jackson County Circuit Court,
Isaac Harrison and Lewatty Isaacs were indicted for adultery.&nbsp; During the
November 1863 term, the case was dismissed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Commonwealth against Isaac Harrison and Luetta Isaacs:&nbsp; ordered
that this cause be set aside and that this cause be dismissed at plaintiff's
motion and therefore adjudged by the court and the plaintiff recover of the
defendant Harrison expenses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><b>5. Hezekiah Isaacs</b> was born about 1835 in Clay or Madison
County.&nbsp; He appeared in the 1850 as &quot;Esikiah.&quot;&nbsp; He married Rebecca Sloan
in Madison County.&nbsp; The Madison County marriage records only listed a bond
date of 9 June 1856, but Hezekiah listed the actual marriage date of 10 June
1856 on his Civil War pension application.&nbsp; James Smith and Sarah Johnson
witnessed the marriage.&nbsp; Rebecca was the daughter of Hardin Sloan and Nancy Isaacs.&nbsp; Since Nancy
Isaacs Sloan and James Isaacs were siblings, Rebecca and Hezekiah were first
cousins.&nbsp; Hezekiah was a Corporal in Company A, 47th KY Volunteer Mounted
Infantry.&nbsp; He enlisted July 3rd, 1863 and was honorably discharged December
26th, 1864.&nbsp; According to the Civil War pension papers, Hezekiah died 14 June 1902 in
Bighill, Madison County and Rebecca died September 19th, 1907 in Bighill,
Madison County, Kentucky.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The actual trial transcripts no longer exist, so we might never know who
James R. was convicted of killing.&nbsp; Was it his brother, Samuel,&nbsp; who
was murdered during the same time period?&nbsp; This seems somewhat unlikely
considering the level of family support regarding bail, etc. Was it someone who murdered his
brother?&nbsp; Jackson County death records also
list the death of John Morris, 73, who was murdered on 20 January 1859.&nbsp;
Could James R. have been indicted for the the murder of John Morris?&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1874
James R. Isaacs and Job Morris each had to sign a peace bond
        (Jackson County Circuit Court Order Bk. 3), agreeing&nbsp; not to
        comment an offense against each other.&nbsp;Job Morris was the son of
V.W. Morris who was the son of John Morris.&nbsp; Maybe there was a feud and
it was still going on 15 years later.</p>
<p>I received this from Donny Perry, a descendant of John Morris:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">I was not sure who it was that shot my John Morris ... Jess
  Wilson who lives down on Possum Trot in Clay Co. told me the following,
  &quot;John Morris and Robert Hays had been the main instigators in forming
  Jackso[n] County. The[y] had a difficulty about the division of the county
  into districts. Each want[ed] to be in the McKee division without the other.
  They excused themselves from the committee that met to make the divide. The
  others favored Hays and jerrymander to include him.&nbsp; Morris moved out to
  where the Isaacs lived.&nbsp; ...I just heard that an Isaacs man killed John

<p align="left">I am not sure if the Samuel involved in this suit was James
Sr.'s brother &quot;Mystery Sam&quot; or James' son Samuel who was murdered in
1859.&nbsp; Since James Sr. paid the bail for all of them, it seems more likely
to me that it was James' son Samuel, who was involved in the
assault.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">During the November term, 1858,&nbsp; James R. Isaacs' father
in law,&nbsp; John Clemons, was indicted for malicious stabbing, and also for
perjury.&nbsp; It was during the very next session of the court, June term 1859,
that James R. was indicted.&nbsp; It is hard to believe that the indictments of James R. and his
father in law were unrelated.&nbsp; Especially since James Isaacs, the father of
James R. paid the bail for John Clemons.&nbsp; During the November 1859 session
of the Circuit Court, James R.'s father and brother George W. were also indicted for
murder.&nbsp; In spite of all these indictments, James R. Isaacs was the only
one who actually served time in prison.&nbsp; The charges against the others
were all eventually dropped for various reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">On the 1860 census James R. Isaacs was listed as an inmate in prison in Frankfort.&nbsp;
His sentence was for two years.&nbsp; After his release, James R. enlisted on 5
August 1861 in&nbsp; Company E, 1st KY Volunteer Cavalry, as
a Private.&nbsp; At the time he indicated he was 25 years old, 5 feet 11 inches
high, fair complexion, blue eyes, light hair and a farmer by trade.&nbsp; He
said he was born in Madison County.&nbsp; He was granted a disability discharge on the 14th of February 1863 at Louisville,
Ky.&nbsp; He had cardiac disease and tuberculosis
deposits.&nbsp; He died 16 April 1880 in Jackson County of a gun shot wound.</p>

possibility that she is the unknown Jane that does sign all four of the deeds
(see deed discussion below) or she could have died prior to 1860.</p>

was a Lewis age 11.&nbsp; Cyrus and
Lewis were most likely the same person. Neither a Cyrus nor a Lewis signed any of James'
probate related papers in Jackson County, but they were all signed by a Masiah, an
heir I can't identify.&nbsp; Maybe Masiah was Lewis, was Cyrus, who knows?&nbsp;
The 1870 Jackson County census listed a Cias Isaacs 21, married to a Samira.&nbsp;
The census indicated that they had been married in December of the census year,
which would be December 1869.&nbsp; On the marriage
record&nbsp;of Tyree Isaacs in Estill County in 1895, Tyree was listed as the son
of Cyrus Isaacs and Samera Bicknell.&nbsp; Maybe Cyrus was Lewis
was Masiah was Cias, who knows?&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't find a Cyrus/ Cias/ Lewis or
Masiah on the 1880 census, but on the 1900 census there was a Farley Isaacs who
was listed as being born in Sept 1882.&nbsp; He living with his grandparents
Tyra and Ann Beckell.&nbsp; On his death certificate, Farley Isaacs parents were
listed as Cyrus Isaacs and Myra Becknell.&nbsp; (The information about Farley
came from Geneva Rudolph and Darlene and Charles Isaacs.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>2. Fielding Isaac</b>s was born about 1851 in Madison County.&nbsp;
He was living with his parents in 1860 and with his widowed mother in Jackson County in 1870.</p>

she was not

She would have been 17 and could have been married.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><b>4. William R. Isaacs</b> was born about 1854 in Madison County.&nbsp; He
signed his name William Riley on all the probate related documents.&nbsp; He

<p align="left"><b>5. Hardin Isaacs</b> was born about 1857 in Madison County.&nbsp; He
married Surilda Bicknell on 1 March 1876 in Estill.&nbsp; The marriage

Elizabeth Davis Isaacs and several of her children were living with Hardin and
Surilda in 1880 in Estill County.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>6. Andrew Isaacs</b> was born about 1859 in Madison County.&nbsp; He, his
mother and his sister Emily were living with Andrew's older brother Hardin and
his wife Surilda in Estill County in 1880.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>7. Mary A. Isaacs</b> was born about 1860 in Madison County.&nbsp; There
was a Mary Jane who signed two of the four probated related documents. I assume that
Mary Jane and Mary A. were the same person.&nbsp; She appeared as
Mary A., a 10 year old with her widowed mother on the 1870 census in Jackson
County.&nbsp; Mary Ann/Mary Jane was not listed&nbsp; with her mother and
siblings on the 1880 census in Estill.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>8. Emily Isaacs</b> was born about 1862 in Madison.&nbsp; She was
most likely the Emily Isaacs who married Dair Lawson on 20 December 1877 in
Jackson County, with Elizabeth
Isaacs and Godfrey Isaacs witnesses and Dar Larson and Anderson Carpenter
bondsmen.&nbsp; They were married near H. Pearson's house in Jackson County,
according to the bond.&nbsp; This record was almost impossible to read.&nbsp;
Geneva Rudolph told me that the name of the groom was actually Dan Harrison or
Larrison.&nbsp; Emily, her
brother Andrew and her widowed mother were living with her older brother Hardin and his
wife Surilda in Estill County in 1880.&nbsp; Emily was listed as a widow on
the census.&nbsp; Emily married again in Estill County: &quot;Ansil Bicknell (23, 1st marriage) to Emily Isaacs
(20, 2nd marriage), 21 April 1881.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ansil D. Bicknell was the son of
Tyree Bicknell and Mariam Willis.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Unknown children&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p><i><b>Children from the 1850 Census</b></i></p>
<p><b>1. Isaac </b> was born about 1846, he was 4 on the 1850 census, listed as Isaac
Isaacs.&nbsp; On the
1860 census there was an Isaac Davis 14, living with James Isaacs.&nbsp; Since
the 1850 census did not distinguish between Isaacs and Davis children, it is
possible that Isaac was a Davis. Since he was 4 in 1850 his birth was probably
in1846, long after&nbsp; November 1843, when the Laurel Court, recognizing
Elizabeth as a widow, made arrangements for her children. If he was a Davis
there are two possibilities that I can think of:&nbsp; (1) Isaac might have been
a grandchild of Elizabeth, but her oldest child listed in the Laurel County
court proceedings was Martha, who was 11 in 1843.&nbsp; I suppose it was
possible that Elizabeth had older children since she would have been about 20
when Martha was born. But usually even though children 14 and older have more
legal rights than those under 14, they are still mentioned in the proceedings.
(2) Isaac might have been an illegitimate child of Elizabeth Davis, a child born
after the death of her husband.</p>
<p>In the 1870 census an Isaac Isaacs age 24, married to Alsay Johnson,&nbsp;seems to show up
out of nowhere.&nbsp; His marriage bond was listed in Jackson on 30 August
1867.&nbsp; James R. Isaacs was his bondsman.&nbsp; He was living next door to James' daughter, Lewatty&nbsp;Isaacs
and her 2nd husband Isaac Harrison in
1880.&nbsp; Isaac and Alsay had children named James, Rhoda, Ambrose, Hardin, all the right
names to belong to the James Isaacs family, but I
can't place him.&nbsp; Maybe he was Isaac Davis,
who decided to take the Isaacs name, since he was raised by James, or maybe there
was a separate Isaac
Isaacs born in 1846 that just didn't appear on the 1850 or 1860 census.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
his name wasn't listed on any of the above deeds as an heir, I think it is
doubtful that he was a son of James Isaacs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>2. Rhenny</b> was born about 1846, she was 4 on the 1850 census.&nbsp; Rhenny
was most likely
Sarena an illegitimate daughter of
Lucinda Isaacs.&nbsp; Sarena was living with her mother in 1860.</p>
<p align="left"><b>3. Lovency</b>&nbsp; was born about 1847, and was 3 on the 1850 census.&nbsp; This
name didn't appear on the 1860 census in
James' household.&nbsp; There was an Elizabeth Davis age 13 living with
James Isaacs.&nbsp; Maybe Lovency was Elizabeth?&nbsp; It is possible that
Lovency/Elizabeth was also an illegitamate child of Elizabeth Davis, a sister to
Isaac above.&nbsp; But since Elizabeth and James were married in August of 1847,
it doesn't seem very likely.&nbsp; I don't know if Lovency is
traditionally a Davis name, but it, and all its variations appears frequently in
the James Isaacs family.&nbsp; It is also possible that Lovency was another
illegitimate granddaughter of James Isaacs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><i><b>Children from the 1860 Census</b></i></p>
<p><b>1. James</b> age 12.&nbsp; James Isaacs Sr. already had a son James R. born about
1837, who was incarcerated in Franklin County in 1860.&nbsp; Elizabeth also had a son
James by her first husband who would have been 22 or 23 in 1860, so it is unlikely that this
child belonged to either James Sr. or Elizabeth Davis.&nbsp; It seems more likely
that he was a grandchild or some other relative.</p>
<p><i><b>Children/heirs listed and not listed on the deeds</b></i></p>
<p><i>I am going to refer to the deeds as follows: 1st - George's deed, 2nd -
James R's deed, 3rd - Hardin's&nbsp; (Sloan) deed, 4th- 1869 deed. </i></p>
<p><b>Masiah/Messiah Isaacs</b> signed all four of the deeds, but I can't identify him.&nbsp;
I have speculated that he might be Lewis/Cyrus.&nbsp; However there is a vital
record in Jackson County concerning the death of a Sarah Isaacs, age 13, female,
who died 14 March 1854, kicked by a horse, daughter of Mcsh Isaacs.&nbsp; The
name is really hard to read, but this is what it looks like to me.&nbsp; If
anyone has a clue about this Mcsh, I would sure appreciate the information. </p>
<p><b>Jane Isaacs </b> signed all four of the deeds, but I don't know who she is either.&nbsp;
She can't be Mary A. (sometimes a Mary Ann is referred to as Mary Jane or vice versa), because Mary A.
is already listed as an heir on George's deed and
Hardin's deed.&nbsp;Jane might be Elizabeth, the daughter of James Isaacs and
his first wife, who is 10 on the 1850 census.&nbsp; Elizabeth does not appear
with the family on the 1860 census, but as I mentioned earlier, she would have
been 20
years old and might have been married or out of the house working.&nbsp; It has been suggested that this Jane might
be Elizabeth Jane the eldest daughter of Samuel Isaacs, James's deceased
son.&nbsp; We just don't know.&nbsp; This might be one of those mysteries that
is never solved. </p>
<p>In addition to Jane (mentioned above) the 1869 deed was also signed by a
Sarah Isaacs, James Isaacs, Lovica Isaacs and Louvina Isaacs.&nbsp; Samuel
Isaacs, the deceased son of James, had children Sarah, James and Lavina.&nbsp;
If Lavina were Lovica or Louvina then we have accounted for three of the
four.&nbsp; Lovica (?) is really hard to read on the 1869 deed and so is Lovency
(?) on the 1850 census.&nbsp; I have found no other record of Lovica/Lovency and
with other similar names like Lavina, Lucinda, Louisa and Lewatty in James'
family, it is very difficult to keep track of all these girls. </p>
<p>Those heirs that did sign, didn't necessarily sign all the deeds.&nbsp;
Hezekiah signed the 1869 deed and was listed as someone with no interest in the
other three deeds. Fielding didn't
sign George's deed.&nbsp; Elender only signed the 1869 deed, and as I mentioned
earlier Mary A. only signed the George and Hardin deeds.</p>
