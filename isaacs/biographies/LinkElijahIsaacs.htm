<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Elijah Isaacs and Sally Bowman</font></b></p>
<p>Elijah Isaacs was born about 1808 in Virginia.&nbsp; He was the son of <a href="/isaacs/biographies/LinkSamuelNancy.htm"> Samuel
Isaacs and Nancy Baldridge</a>.&nbsp; He married Sarah/Sally Bowman on the 15th of
April 1830 in Clay County.&nbsp; Sally was the daughter of Jacob Bowman and
Elander Evans.&nbsp; Elijah and Sally&nbsp;appeared on the 1830 census of Clay
County, but I haven't found them on the 1840 census.&nbsp; They were most likely
missed by the enumerators or living with another family because Elijah appeared
on the Clay County tax list consistently from 1829 through 1843.&nbsp; &nbsp;
Owsley County was formed in 1843 and Elijah was listed on Owsley's first tax
list in 1844. Elijah and Sally were listed in the Owsley
County census in 1850, 1860, 1870 and 1880.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elijah Isaacs was received into the Elk Lick Baptist Church by
&quot;experience and baptism&quot; on the 11th of August, 1843. Susan Isaac was
also &quot;received by experience and baptism&quot; in October, 1843.&nbsp;Susan
Isaac was most likely the wife of Fielding Isaacs, Elijah's brother.&nbsp; In
June, 1844, &quot;Brother Elijah Isaacs came forward and let the church know the
hurt between him and Susan Isaac.&quot;&nbsp; Unfortunately, whoever was keeping
the church minutes didn't make a record of what the particular hurt was.&nbsp;
Elijah continued to appear in the Elk Lick Baptist Church records through
February, 1878, When Elijah Isaacs and W. A. Smith were appointed to cite J. M.
Roberts and wife to fill their seats.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elijah is buried in the Elijah Isaacs
Cemetery in Owsley County, in plot #8.&nbsp;&nbsp; This cemetery is located on the James Hurt farm, near the Elk Lick Baptist Church.&nbsp;
The cemetery has also been called the Elk Lick or Buck Creek
Cemetery. One of the reasons we know so little
about Elijah is that Owsley County suffered a courthouse fire in January 1928.&nbsp; County histories claim that 5000 marriage records were lost as well
as most land and court records prior to 1929.</p>
