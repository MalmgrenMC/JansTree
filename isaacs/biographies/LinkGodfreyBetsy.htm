</p>
<p>Godfrey Isaacs and Elizabeth (Betsy) Howard were married 2 February 1810 in
Clay County.&nbsp; Godfrey was probably about 35 and Betsy was probably about 20.&nbsp; Godfrey might have been married before, but
I have not found an earlier marriage for him.<STRONG>  </STRONG>Godfrey was
born in North Carolina about 1775, the son of <a href="LinkGodfreySr.htm"> Godfrey Isaacs&nbsp;</a>
(Jackson County Vital Records-
deaths.)&nbsp; He first appeared on the tax records of Russell
County, Virginia in 1797.&nbsp; Godfrey appeared in Clay County in
1810, in Estill County in both 1820 and 1830.&nbsp; In 1840
he was in Madison County.&nbsp; I am not sure how many children Godfrey and Betsy had in
total, but at the
time of Godfrey's death, they had 15 living children.&nbsp; Godfrey's son
Fielding died 30 December 1858 and his share of the estate was given to his
widow, Leanna Lakes Isaacs.&nbsp; In one land division she was listed as a
daughter of Godfrey Isaacs, rather than a daughter in law.&nbsp; Godfrey's oldest son William
died in 1861 or 1862 and his estate and that of his father's were joined together.&nbsp;
Their joint estates were then divided among Godfrey's 13 remaining living
children and Leanna Lakes Isaacs, the widow of his son Fielding.
</p>
<p>Jackson County Vital Records listed
Godfrey Isaacs' death as 23 May 1858 at age 91.  The 1850 census, as well as
previous censuses indicated he
was closer to 83.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Jackson County Vital Records, &quot;Godfrey Isaacs, 91, married, died 23 May
1858, pneumonia, son of Godfrey Isaacs and wife, born in North Carolina, residing
in Jackson.&quot;
</p>
<p>According to Geneva Rudolph, Elizabeth Howard was the daughter of Henry H.
Howard who was born 2 October 1763 in Virginia and died 17 March 1798 in Clark
County, Kentucky, and his wife Isabella Griffin who was born 1750 in Virginia and died 25
June 1850 in Powell County, Kentucky.&nbsp; Henry and Isabella were married 19 October
1780 in Rockingham County, Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In 1860,
after Godfrey's death, Elizabeth was living with her son William in Jackson
County.&nbsp; After William's death,&nbsp; Anna Jane
became responsible for her mother.&nbsp; Jackson County Court Records, July term, 1867, p.
20:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Court orders that the county should pay $5.00 for the maintenance of Mrs.
Elizabeth Isaacs and Anna Jane Isaacs be appointed her committee.
</p>
<p>Elizabeth Howard Isaacs was living with her daughter Rebecca Isaacs in 1870.&nbsp; She
didn't appear on the
1880 census, she was most likely deceased.

<b><font size="4">Children of Godfrey Isaacs and Elizabeth Howard&nbsp;</font></b>
</p>
<p align="left">
<b>
1. William Isaacs</b> was born about 1811. After the death of his father, Godfrey,
in 1858, William was appointed executor
of his estate. During the June term, 1860 of the Jackson County Court, Will
Isaacs was indicted for gaming.&nbsp; During the November term, 1860, the cause
was abated by reason of the death of the defendant.&nbsp; After William's death,
his estate was added to his father's (Godfrey) and divided among William's 13
siblings and the widow of his brother, Fielding. I can't find any evidence that William ever married or had
any children.  He was enumerated with his parents on the 1850 census and with his widowed mother on the 1860
census.
</p>
<p align="left">
<b>
2.  John Isaacs</b> was born about 1812.  He married Isabella Moore 6 Sept 1838
in Clay County.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of William, John became the executor of his father's and brother's
estates.&nbsp; John was in Madison County in 1850 and in Jackson County in 1860,
1870 and 1880.<br>
<br>
<b>
3.  Sarah Isaacs</b> was born about 1813.  She married James Gray 16 June 1836
in Estill County.&nbsp; Sarah was in Owsley County in 1850.&nbsp; I can't find her in
1860 or 1870, but she was listed as a widow, and living with her sister Anna Jane
Harrison in 1880 in Jackson County.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>
4. Rachael Isaacs</b> was born about 1815.  She married Allen Newton 29 Oct 1835
in Estill County.&nbsp; She was living in Owsley County in 1850 and 1860 and in Lee
County in 1870.&nbsp; I can't find her on the 1880 census.
</p>
<p align="left"><b>5. Evaline Isaacs</b> was born 1 May 1817.&nbsp; She married Elisha W. Bowman 19 July 1835.
He was born 2 February 1815 in Clay County.&nbsp; She was living in Breathitt
County in 1850 and in Owsley County in 1860, 1870 and 1880.<br>
<br>
<b>
6. Nancy Isaacs</b> was born about 1818.  She married John M. Collins on 8 March
1843 in Estill County.&nbsp; John and Nancy were in Madison County in 1850, and in Jackson
County in 1860.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">Jackson County Court Records, April term 1863,&nbsp; p. 326:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p> On motion of G. Isaacs ordered that John Collins be allowed $15.00 as
he is confined to his bed by rheumatism and has no means of support. John Isaacs
is his community as John Collins is a pauper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>February term 1864,&nbsp; p. 498 John Isaacs was paid $25.00 for the support
of John Collins.</p>
<p align="left">Nancy was listed as a widow in 1870 and 1880 in Jackson County.<br>
<br>
<b>
7. Samuel Isaacs</b> was born 21 July 1820.  He married Eliza Crawford about 1847,
probably in Owsley County.&nbsp; Eliza Crawford was
born 17 February 1832 in Estill County.&nbsp; She was the daughter of Joseph Crawford and Nancy Gray.&nbsp;
Samuel and Eliza were living
in Owsley County in 1850, and in Jackson County in 1860, 1870 and 1880. Samuel died 26
July 1899 in Garvin County, Oklahoma and was buried in McGee Cemetery, in Garvin
County, Oklahoma.&nbsp; Eliza died 2 March 1920, probably in Garvin County, but was
buried in Maxwell Cemetery in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma.
</p>
<p align="left">
<b>
8. Elizabeth Isaacs</b> was born about 1821.  She doesn't seem to have married.&nbsp;
She was living with her mother in 1860 and with her sister Anna Jane in 1870 and 1880.&nbsp; She
might have had some form of impairment indicated by this Jackson County Court Records, June term
1874, pg 448:&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">A rule is made against Ann Jane Harrison and Elizabeth Isaacs to
appear in this court to show cause why there should not be a committee appointed
for Elizabeth Isaacs.&nbsp;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Since Mrs. Elizabeth Isaacs was still alive in 1870, there is a
possibility that this court record might be about Anna Jane's mother rather than
her sister.&nbsp; Although we might not ever know definitively, a couple
of&nbsp; things seem to support the theory that this Elizabeth was Anna Jane's
sister:
</p>
<p align="left">a. The 1867 court record made reference to <i>Mrs</i>.
Elizabeth Isaacs, whereas the 1873 record merely stated Elizabeth Isaacs.
</p>
<p align="left">b. In I870, Elizabeth, the sister, was living with Anna Jane,
whereas Mrs. Elizabeth Isaacs, the mother, was living with her daughter Rachel.

9. Elisha Isaacs</b> was born about 1823.  He married Sally Harrison 3 November 1852
in Estill County.&nbsp;He was in Owsley County in 1850, and in Jackson County in
1860,
1870 and 1880.
</p>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<br>
<b>
10. Caroline Isaacs</b> was born about 1827.  She married Ambrose Brockman 6 March
1845 in Madison County.&nbsp; She apparently died prior to November 1868
when Ambrose remarried.&nbsp; I originally thought Carolyn was a child of
Godfrey and Keziah, but Caroline and her husband Ambrose were listed as heirs in
the land division of the estate of Godfrey and William Isaacs, (Jackson Co. Land
Records, Book 1, pg. 167).
</p>
<p><b>11. Godfrey Isaacs</b> was born about 1826.  He married Emiline Crawford about
1846 in Estill County.&nbsp; Emiline was born about 1830 and was the daughter of
Joseph Crawford and Nancy Gray.&nbsp; Godfrey served during the Civil War in Company E, 47th
KY Volunteer (Mounted) Infantry.&nbsp; He was in Madison County in 1850, and in
Estill County in 1860 and 1870.&nbsp; In 1880 the family was in Grayson, Texas.&nbsp;
Godfrey was a Civil War pensioner in 1890.&nbsp; Godfrey and Emiline were living in Cook County, Texas when
they died.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>12. Rebecca Isaacs</b> was born about 1830.  She was living with her parents in
Madison County in 1850, and with her mother and brother William in Jackson County in 1860.&nbsp;
The 4 year old Henry that was living with them was most likely her son, since he
was living with her in 1870 in Jackson County.&nbsp; Her mother, Elizabeth Howard Isaacs was living with her as well as what appeared to
be her two sons, Henry 14, and Ambrose B. 8.&nbsp; On the 1870 census, Elizabeth Howard Isaacs
age was listed as 76, but according to the previous censuses, she was probably 80.<br>
<br>
<b>
13.  Fielding Isaacs</b> was born about 1831.  He married Leanna Lakes 18 November
1852 in Estill County.&nbsp; I can't find Fielding on the 1850 census.&nbsp; We
know from the Jackson County Vital Records that he died 30 Dec 1858 of consumption.&nbsp;
His widow Leanna Lakes Isaacs married 2nd Shelton Harrison, son of John B.
Harrison and Sarah Brockman sometime between 1860 and 1870.<br>
<br>
<b>
14.  Anna Jane Isaacs</b> was born about 1832. She appeared on the 1850 Madison
County census with her parents, and on the 1860 Jackson County census with her older
brother William and her widowed mother.&nbsp; She married Elisha Harrison 4
May 1863 in Jackson County.&nbsp; Elisha Harrison had previously married Martha
Ann Rose on 10 November 1855, in Madison County.&nbsp; Elisha Harrison brought divorce
proceedings against his wife Martha Ann in June of 1861.&nbsp; The final judgment was
filed in June 1862:&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Elisha
Harrison served in Co. E, 1st KY Volunteer Cavalry during the Civil War.&nbsp; Apparently,
Elisha Harrison and Ann Jane Isaacs had no children of their own, but Ann Jane
became the guardian of the children of Elisha Harrison and Martha Rose, after
the death of Elisha Harrison sometime prior to February 1867. The guardianship was listed
in the Jackson County Court Order Book, February term, 1867, p. 544:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>On the motion of Ann Jane Harrison and the court being fully advised, it is
  therefore ordered that she, Ann Jane Harrison be and she is hereby appointed
  guardian to the infant heirs of Elisha Harrison deceased, viz: John P. B.
  Harrison born 4 November 1856, B.B. Harrison born 27 December 1858, John S.
  Harrison born 13 January 1861 and whereupon she came forward and entered into
  bond with William C. Harrison and Thomas Harrison security and she took oath
  as the law requires.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B. B. Harrison was listed as Burges B. Harrison on the 1860 census.&nbsp; There was probably an error by the court clerk when he listed John S.
Harrison born 13 January 1861.&nbsp; The same person was listed as&nbsp; Joseph S.
Harrison on the 1870 census.&nbsp; John P. B. Harrison was listed as Palestine Harrison
on the 1880 census.<br>
<br>
<b>
15. Henry S. Isaacs</b> was born 11 May 1835.&nbsp; He married Mary Jane Lakes 22 March
1860 in Jackson County.&nbsp; Mary Jane Lakes was the daughter of Greenbury
Lakes and Nancy Jane Harrison.&nbsp; Henry served during the Civil War in Company F, 14th
KY Volunteer Cavalry.&nbsp; Henry was living with his family in Madison County in
1850.&nbsp; He was in Jackson County in 1860, 1870 and 1880.&nbsp; In 1910 he
wrote a letter to the Bureau of Pensions which listed the names of his siblings:</p>
