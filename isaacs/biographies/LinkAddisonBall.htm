<p>Addison Ball was born 18 May 1822 in North Carolina.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his
Civil War pension deposition, Joshua Ball, son of Addison and Abigail,
said he had never met his grandparents who lived in Buncombe County, North
Carolina, but his grandfather's name was Aamraphael Ball, who died in
1880.&nbsp; Joshua didn't mention his grandmother's name but said he thought she
had died about 1865.&nbsp; Ball family members have told me that Addison's
mother was Elizabeth Holcomb.&nbsp; Addison Ball married Abigail&nbsp; Adeline Robbins&nbsp;
Abigail discussed her marriage in a
deposition she gave for her Civil War pension application on the 6th of March
1884.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was married by Robert Patterson, a Baptist preacher, on Little Ivy,
Yancey County, August 1, 1839.&nbsp; We were married by license from the
county court of Yancey County, N.C. located at Burnsville.&nbsp; We were married
at my mother's [Mary Robbins],(my maiden name was Abagail A. Robins).&nbsp; When
we were married there were present my sister Mary Holt, of&nbsp; Moores Creek,
Jackson County, KY - also William Carter of Little Ivy and Ansil George of same place.&nbsp; George Briggs and Daniel Carter and Thomas Runyons and others.
I expect there were 75 or 100 people present and saw us married.&nbsp; They all
were my neighbors on Little Ivy, Yancey Co. N.C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abigail Adeline Robbins was the daughter of <a href="/isaacs/biographies/LinkMaryRobbins.htm"> Jonathan Robbins and Mary
Masagee/Massingail.</a>&nbsp; She was born 11 April 1823 in Randolph County, North
Carolina.&nbsp; In her Civil War pension application she said that she had 13
children and raised 12 of them.&nbsp; [William Franklin Ball died in infancy.]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addison and Abigail appear on the 1840 census of Yancey County, N.C. both
between 15 and 20 years of age with no children in the household.&nbsp; In his Civil
War deposition, Addison said the family moved from N.C.&nbsp; to Goose Creek, Clay
County,
Kentucky in 1848, and lived in the McWhorter settlement in Clay County.&nbsp;
Abigail's widowed mother, Mary Masagee Robbins, was living with them in 1850. On
one of his depositions for a Civil War pension, Addison said he moved to Sturgeon Creek in Jackson County in the spring of 1858 and then to Pond Creek near where William May and Minatree Turner lived.  They only stayed there a little while, and then
moved to Perry McWhorters in 1859.  In 1860 they made a crop at Perry McWhorters and rented another place close by and made a crop in 1861.  They moved then to Laurel County close to Andy Cornelius' neighborhood about 1/12 miles from Moshon's Caves
Road and lived there through the year 1862.&nbsp;
The family was listed on the 1860 census of Clay County.</p>
<p>
Addison Ball enlisted as a Private&nbsp; in Co. G, with the 47th KY infantry at Camp
Wilson, KY near Irvine in Estill County, in July 1863.&nbsp; He was discharged in
November 1864 as a corporal, after having served 1 year and 4 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While living in Rockcastle County, Addison applied for an invalid pension
in1877, describing himself as 54 years old, 5 feet 11 inches tall with a fair
complexion, black hair and yellow eyes.&nbsp; He claimed that on the 25th of
July 1864, while unloading a wagon, a box of bacon
fell on his right thigh.&nbsp; In a declaration filed 23 June 1879, he claimed that the
injury caused fistula and diarrhea. .
In one of her depositions, Abigail mentioned that Addison walked on crutches for
the last seven years before he died.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Catherine Holcomb, wife of Solomon Holcomb (a cousin of Addison's) said in her deposition dated
8 May 1885, &quot;I think he [Addison]&nbsp; was about 50 when he went into the Army.  He told me once that he should never have gone in the Army.&quot;&nbsp;
[Addison was actually 40 when he enlisted.]</p>
<p>In 1864, Addison and Abigail moved to the Dry Fork of Pond Creek and lived next to Manuel Arnold and George W. Cook.&nbsp;
In another deposition Addison gave this record of all the places he lived after the war:</p>
<p>He moved back to Clay
County after his discharge&nbsp;<br>
He moved to Laurel County in 1868<br>
He moved back to Clay County in 1870<br>
He moved to Rockcastle County in 1872&nbsp;<br>
He moved back to Clay County in 1879<br>
<br>
Addison Ball died 7 July 1881 in Sextons Creek, Jackson County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On
the 3rd of October 1911, Joshua L. Ball wrote to the Commissioner of
Pensions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
My mother Mrs. Abagail A. Ball, widow of Addison Ball who served in Corporal Co.
G. 47 Regt. Kentucky Volunteers holds Pension Certificate number 227640 of
twelve dollars a month has through the infirmities of old age become absolutely
helpless and her condition is such that requires constant attention and as I am
sixty two years of age I am unable to work and provide the additional amount
necessary to employ the assistance of a nurse for her.&nbsp; And as the amount
of twelve dollars per month is insufficient to support my mother and pay for
help in caring for her properly I write you to find out whether or not there is
any provision in the law that will grant an additional amount to her present
pension to cover these expenses which would justify both her case and my efforts
to maintain her while she is nearly one hundred years old [Abigail was actually
about 88 years old.]&nbsp; I can furnish evidence to verify these facts and will thank
you to promptly inform me as to the prospects for this increase and I will
readily fill out any papers you may send me for this evidence.&nbsp; Awaiting
your reply, I am Yours Respt.&nbsp; Joshua L. Ball, Orlando, Rockcastle Co.
KY.</p>

In 1879 at Preston Parrots house, Mrs. Ball and I were there sitting up with Mrs. Parrot (Mrs Ball's daughter Martha J.) and I asked Mrs. Ball how Add was getting along and she said he was very bad off.<br>

I could not tell what, I think that we was connection [sic].&nbsp;[This is not 
the same William Robinson who married Elender Ball. This William is listed on 
the 1880 census of Laurel County as 51 years old born in NC and&nbsp; married to

<br>
<b>
Joshua L. Ball</b> - 26th of February 1885 at Chinquapin Rough, Jackson County - I am 35 years old. My P.O. is High Knob, Clay
County, KY.  I am a farmer and a son of Addison and Abigail A. Ball.   I never saw my father's father or mother.  They lived in North Carolina in
Buncombe County.  Grandfather died in 1880.  His name was
Aamraphael Ball.  He died in 1880.  I think my Grandmother died twenty years ago.  One of my sister's now dead had what was supposed to be the scrofula when she was small.  She had a swelling under the right ear, that mother supposed to be the scrofula.  One of my sister's that is living did have what was supposed to be scrofula.  She was afflicted with a knot, a hard
knot up and down the side of her neck, which was called scrofula.  Her name is Polly M. Lacefield, she lives in Rockcastle County on Brush Creek about two miles from Langford Post Office.  I can't say how long but she went to Dr. McDonnells and stayed there and was doctored for it and she said it cured her.  Margaret A. who is now dead, I heard my mother say that she thought the scrofula was working on her.  She is the one I first mentioned.  I think she was 18 or 19 when she died, maybe 20.  She was married and had one child.  Her husband was James Barnett who lives on Brush Creek in Rockcastle County.
When she was very small she had something the matter with one of her ears and probably her neck.  Her ear would swell all over her whole ear.  I don't know of any other members of the family who have been troubled with scrofula.<br>

forget when- she is the only one that ever had it that I know of.  I never knew father or mother to have it.  Mother had what they called a rose cancer growing on her knee at one time.  "When did you get married,"  May 13, 1869 on Pond Creek in Jackson County.  I lived with my parents until then, except when I worked out.</p>
<p><b>Henry Hellard</b> - 29th of September 1885, at Mershon's Road, Laurel

Kentucky volunteers and was at Kimbro Bridge near Cynthan and saw Addison Ball
engaged in unloading a Government wagon and a box fell and struck him on the
thigh from which he received a severe wound which disabled him for duty.</p>
<p><i><b>Abigail --&nbsp; discussing her children's illnesses:</b></i><br>
<br>
Polly's was at McDowell's in the summer and fall of 1867. Polly had holes for her ear rings made in her ears.  And after that a rising in front of her left ear came and broke and run for some time.  Dr. McDowell gave her medicine for it and treated her for scrofula.  Her rising got well and after that she appeared to have a hacking cough.  The only swelling she had was right in front of her ear on her face.  She never had any swelling on her neck.<br>
<br>
Lina had a puffed ear from birth.  She was born with it. It broke and ran.  At her death she ran at both ears.  She died at the age of 23 of liver complaint.  The doctor's called it
neuralgia consumption.<br>
<br>
"How many children have you lost?"<br>
<br>
Three in all.  My baby died of flux- William Franklin.  He was a year old.  Martha died of liver complaint which ran into
neuralgia consumption just like Lina.  She was 25 years old.<br>
<br>
"How many children have you living?"<br>
<br>
Ten, and 42 grandchildren and seven great grand children.</p>

William Robinson,&nbsp; says he was not sure of the relation, but he knows they are
connection [sic]<br>
Dr. John Ward, age 76 in 1885, knew Addison when he was in Buncombe Co. NC.  Addison was a small boy at the time.   Dr. Ward left NC in 1832.</p>
<p><b>Some answers:</b></p>
<p>I received an email from Lynn Jones a descendant of John and Daniel
Ward.&nbsp; According to Lynn, Daniel Ward's wife was Mary Elmira Halcomb.&nbsp;
Mary was born 30 September 1831 and died 14 December 1896.&nbsp; She married
Daniel Ward in Clay County on 17 August 1852.&nbsp; Daniel was an ordained
Baptist minister.&nbsp; He appeared in the Clay County census in 1860 and 1870.</p>
<p>Lynn also explained that John Ward was born February 19, 1809 in Kentucky but
moved to North Carolina as a young boy.&nbsp; He married Camilla McHone on 27
January 1827 in Buncombe, North Carolina.&nbsp; John and Millie moved to Bull
Skin, Clay, Kentucky in 1831, then to Double Lick Branch, Jackson,
Kentucky.&nbsp; He was a Missionary Baptist preacher and a doctor.&nbsp; He is
listed in the 1840 census of Clay County and the 1850 census of Owsley
County.&nbsp; In 1860 he was in Jackson County.&nbsp; Lynn explained that most
of her information came from her brother, Dale Sizemore.&nbsp; Dale interviewed
their grandfather, Everett Ward in 1976.&nbsp; Most of the dates are from
tombstones or records on the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the information provided by Lynn Jones, it seems likely that Mary Elmira
Halcomb is probably the same person as Almira Holcomb 18 in 1850 (Clay County)
and the daughter of Wiley Holcomb and his wife Mary.&nbsp; Wiley Holcomb 56,
born in South Carolina (1850 Clay census) is apparently the brother of Addison
Ball's mother, Elizabeth Holcomb.</p>

<p><i><b>ADDITIONAL CW PENSION PAPERS</b></i></p>
<p>I have the entire Civil War pension file for Addison Ball.&nbsp; I imagine it
is about 500 pages.&nbsp; I didn't include the complete depositions of most
individuals because of the time it would take me to transcribe the record as
well as the space it would take on the site.&nbsp; However, if you are
interested in a more complete account by a deponent, contact me.&nbsp;</p>
