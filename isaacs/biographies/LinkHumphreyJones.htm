<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Humphrey Jones and Susannah Gentry</font></b></p>
<p>Humphrey Jones was born about 1770 in Virginia, the son of William Jones and
Mary Harris.&nbsp; He married Susannah Gentry 7 July 1795 in Madison County,
Kentucky. Susannah was born 26 January 1776 in Albemarle County, Virginia and
was the
daughter of Martin Gentry and Mary Timberlake.&nbsp; We don't know when Susannah
died, she was accounted for on the 1840 census, but on 4 June 1846 Humphrey
married for a 2nd time to Mrs. Mary Hall.&nbsp; I know virtually nothing about this second marriage.
Although Mary appeared with Humphrey on the 1850 census, she was not mentioned in his will which was written originally on 12 June
1845, with codicils on 16 July 1849 and 7 September 1850.&nbsp; I can't identify
her on the 1860 census, and there seems to be no evidence of her receiving her
dower rights in the settlement. Humphrey's will was
probated on the 27th of January 1853 in Madison County:</p>
<p>Last Will and Testament of Humphrey Jones, Sr.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the name of God, Amen.&nbsp; I, Humphrey Jones of Madison County,
Kentucky, do make this my last will and testament.&nbsp; In the first place, I
appoint my sons James and Humphrey and William S. Lipscomb, executors to this my
last will and testament.&nbsp; In the second place, I will and require that if
my son Humphrey should wish to own the eighty-two acres of land I now live on
for a residence for himself than he can and may have the same for the sum of
fifty-five dollars per acre to go to him and his heirs forever.&nbsp; The price
of the land to be divided as my other estate.&nbsp; In the third place, I will
and require that after my death my whole estate that I then possess be equally
divided between all my children. (To Wit) My sons James and Humphrey and Robert
and Richard and my daughters Patsy and Nancy and Susan and Willis F. Jones, and
the children of my daughters Polly and Fanny, with the following deductions and
restrictions, that my sons Robert and Richard&nbsp; and Willis F. Jones each
receive three hundred dollars less than an equal share with the other
children.&nbsp; Polly and Fanny's children only to have their mother's part of
the estate.&nbsp; I hold a note on William S. Lipscomb for six hundred dollars
with interest, to go to the children of my daughter Fanny to remain in the hands
of my executors until they marry or arrive to the age of twenty-one, but in no
event must any of my estate go into the hands of George C. Winn.&nbsp; I will
and require that my slaves Bob and Hannah and Charity and Jane be free at my
death, if they can give security for their maintenance, otherwise to live with
such of my children as they may choose and to be well treated.&nbsp; I will and
require that my other slaves have liberty to choose their masters at their
value.&nbsp; If my son Humphrey will not keep my land as stated, my executors
must sell the land and convey the same and divide the proceeds.&nbsp; In
consideration of faithful services, I will and require that my executors give my
slaves Dodson and Spicy two hundred dollars each to be paid out of my
estate.&nbsp; To all of which I give my hand and seal.&nbsp; June the 12th,
1845.&nbsp; (Witnesses:&nbsp; C.J. Walker, John Scott, J.M. Shackelford, E.W.
White -- February 8th, 1847.)</p>
<p>I make this codicil as part of my will made and signed on the 18th day of
June 1845, hereto corrected.&nbsp; I do hereby appoint my son Richard S. Jones
one of my executors to serve with those that may qualify appointed in the
foregoing will.&nbsp; All the estate I have given to my son Robert in the will
herewith connected, I will and require shall be paid to his children by my son
Richard when they marry or arrive at the age of 21, except one dollar reserved
for said Robert.&nbsp; Given under my hand and seal July 16th, 1849. (Witnesses:
C.W. White, John Shackelford)</p>
<p>I make this codicil to my foregoing will dated June 18th, 1845. (To Wit) So
much of my said will as appoints my son Humphrey on of my executors, I do
hereby revoke and appoint Lemuel D. Bennett in his stead with all the right and
power of acting as my other executor and further as much of my said will as
gives my son Humphrey the liberty to take and hold the eighty-two acres of land
I now live on at fifty-five dollars per acre, I hereby revoke and give him no
advantage over my other children.&nbsp; September 7th, 1850.&nbsp; (Witnesses:
C.W. White, J.M. Shackelford.)</p>
<p>At a County Court held for said County of the 27th day of January 1853, this
instrument of writing was produced in open court and proved to be the last will
and testament of Humphrey Jones Sr., decd. by the oaths of Clayburn W. White and
James M. Shackelford two witnesses thereto and ordered to be recorded and the
same has been done according.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Madison County Court Order Book K, pg 283, Thursday, 20 January 1853,
the will was proven.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An instrument of writing, with two codicils thereto attached purporting to be
the last will and testament of Humphrey Jones, deceased was this day produced
and proven in open court to be such by the oath of Claiborne W. White and James
M. Shackelford, two subscribing witnesses thereto and ordered to be recorded.</p>
<p>--Said White also made proof that James Jones, one of the executors named in
said will was dead and that Richard T. Jones, another executor was a
non-resident of this state and on the motion of William S. Libscomb and Lemuel
D. Bennett the other executor named in said will, a certificate of the probate
thereof is granted thereto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereupon the said Lipscomb and Bennett took the necessary
oath and with Thomas C. S. Brouston and Milo Baxter their sureties, entered into
and acknowledged their bond to the commonwealth of Kentucky as required by law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on their further motion it is ordered that Thomas S.
Brouston Jr, William Harris and Owen W. Wal.ker or any two of them, who being
first sworn, do inventory and appraise the personal estate of said deceased and
make report to this Court.</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Children of Humphrey Jones and Susannah
Gentry</font></b></p>
<p><b>1. James Jones </b> was born 1796 in Madison County.&nbsp; He was apparently alive
in 1850 when his father wrote the last codicil to his will, but as attested to
by William Libscomb, James died prior to 1853 when his father's will was
probated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. Humphrey Jones</b> was born about 1800 in Madison County.&nbsp; He married
Emaline Field about 1831 in Woodford County, Kentucky.&nbsp; After her death he
married Ophelia Bohannan on 1 March 1839 in Woodford, Kentucky.&nbsp; </p>
<p><i>A History of Masonry in Madison County, Kentucky 1812-1913</i>, compiled
and written by Robert R. Burnam, 1914, pg. 58:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HUMPHREY JONES, JR. Was the son of Col. Humphrey Jones, who came to Madison
County from Albemarle County, Virginia, at the close of the eighteenth
century.&nbsp; The father was a gentleman of wealth for his day, entering and
purchasing large tracts of fine land.&nbsp; He was a farmer and trader and a man
of great influence.&nbsp; He represented his county in the State Legislature
many times.&nbsp; If the father was a Mason he must have received the degrees
before coming to Kentucky, because the records of the Grand Lodge fail to show
his name prior to 1824 on the roster of Richmond Lodge, and the name of Humphrey
Jones, Jr., appears in 1825 as a Junior Warden.</p>
<p>Humphrey Jones, Jr., was born in Madison County in 1800, one and one-half
miles east from Richmond.&nbsp; He was well educated, having received the best
advantages afforded by the schools of the community and from private
instruction.&nbsp; He was a very successful business man, being for many years a
merchant in Richmond.&nbsp; He was twice married.&nbsp; His first wife was a
Miss Field of Woodford County, a sister of General Charles Field of Confederate
fame.&nbsp; His second wife was a Miss Bohannon of the same County.&nbsp; He was
a soldier in the Mexican War.&nbsp; Before the beginning of the war between the
states he removed to Woodford County, where he died in 1870. His memory is still
honored by all who knew him as a gentleman of the strictest integrity and
highest character.&nbsp; He was made a Mason in 1825, became&nbsp; Master in
1827, after serving a year as Junior Warden.&nbsp; He was a Royal Arch
Mason.&nbsp; Became High Priest of his Chapter in 1845 and was reelected in
1846.&nbsp; He was elected Grand High Priest of the Grand Chapter in 1851.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>2. William Jones</b> was born 7 May 1792 in Madison County.&nbsp; He was not
mentioned in his father's will because he died prior to 1845.&nbsp; Humphrey
Jones Sr.'s will has often been misread to assume that Willis
Field Jones, the son of William Jones, was a son of Humphrey rather
than a grandson.&nbsp; William Jones married Elizabeth Field on 20 April 1824 in
Woodford County.&nbsp; Elizabeth was the daughter of Willis Field and Isabella
Miriam Buck.&nbsp; Willis Field Jones was their only child. </p>
<p><i>Madison County Order Book H, 3 April 1843, </i>pg. 283 </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This day came Willis F. Jones, orphan of William Jones deceased and made
choice of Richard G. Martin as his guardian, he being over the age of fourteen years
and the said Martin being in Court and coveting to act as such.&nbsp; Whereupon
the said Richard G. Martin entered into and acknowledged bond in the penalty of
$30000 with Humphrey Jones Jr. for his surety and coveted as the law directs. </p>
<p>On the motion of Humphrey Jones Jr. adm. of Wm Jones, deceased, it is ordered
that Thompson Bowman, John Miller, Thomas H. Irwin and Thomas S. Bronston or any
three of them who being first sworn do allot to Elizabeth A. Jones, widow and
relict of William Jones, deceased, her dower in the Real and Personal estate of
said deceased and make report to the Court. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>3. Polly Jones</b> was born about 1805 in Madison County.&nbsp; She married
William S. Lipscomb on 21 September 1826 in Madison County. William was the son
of Nathan Libscomb and Nancy Gentry.&nbsp; Polly and William were first cousins.
Polly died after 1841 when her last child was born and before 1845 when her
father wrote his will.</p>
<p><b>4. Nancy Jones</b> was born about 1809 in Madison County.&nbsp; She married
Lemuel D. Bennett on the 25th of November 1830 in Madison County.&nbsp; William
Turner was the bondsman.&nbsp; The bond date was 23 November 1830.</p>
<p><b>5. <a href="LinkRobertJones.htm"> Robert Jones</a> </b> was born about 1810 in Madison County.&nbsp; He married Polly
Jane Clemons on 13 July 1831 in Madison County.&nbsp; Robert was an avowed abolitionist.
That might be the reason he was cut out of his father's will when Humphrey added
the first codicil in 1849.&nbsp; Robert Jones was a colporteur
(a peddler of religious books) for John G. Fee, the founder of Berea College.  He worked as a representative on the American Missionary
Association. Robert was given a permit to sell tracts <i>Jackson County Court
Order Book B, 1859.&nbsp;</i> He was an anti-slavery activist and was beaten and
harassed on his travels with the Rev. John Fee while proclaiming the evils of slavery
to his fellow Kentuckians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jackson Co. KY, Court Records - Sept term 1872, Robert Jones Sr on account of old age is exonerated from county levy.<br>
<br>
<b>
6. Richard S. Jones</b> was born about 1811 in Madison County.&nbsp; He married
Lucinda Stepton on 15 September 1831 in Madison County.&nbsp; According to the
marriage bond, Lucinda was the daughter of Jesse Stepton.&nbsp; According to
William Lipscomb (see above probate) Richard S. Jones was living out of state in
1853.</p>
<p><b>7.&nbsp; Frances B. Jones</b> was born about 1813 in Madison County.&nbsp; She
married George C. Winn in Madison County.&nbsp; According to the book <i>Madison
County Kentucky Marriage Records, Vol. 2, 1823-1851</i> by Bill and Kathy
Vockery, the bond was dated the 26th of August, 1829, but the return simply
listed July 1829.&nbsp; Both of these can't be correct. They also incorrectly list
Humphrey Jones Jr. as the father of the bride. Fanny died before 1845 when her
father wrote his will.&nbsp; George C. Winn married 2<sup>nd</sup> Mary Evans on 4 November 1848 in Oldham
County. Mary had previously been married to Benjamin Evans.&nbsp; If anyone knows
what George C. Winn did to make Humphrey Jones Sr. dislike him so much, I would
sure appreciate it if they would tell me.</p>
<p><b>8. Patsy Jones</b>&nbsp; - I know nothing about Patsy Jones, except that she was
alive at the time of her father's will.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9. Susan Jones</b> was born about 1823 in Madison County.&nbsp; She married
Richard G. Martin on 15 September 1840 in Madison County.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her nephew,
Willis F. Jones chose Richard G. Martin to be his guardian in 1843. </p>
