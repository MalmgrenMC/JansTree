    <blockquote>
        In 1857/58 Kentucky counties began to keep birth, marriage and death records. Most counties discontinued keeping these records in about 1859, although some continued until 1861. These vital records are extracted from the following counties: Clay, Estill, Jackson, Laurel, Madison, Owsley, Pulaski, and Rockcastle. Some years for some counties are missing.
