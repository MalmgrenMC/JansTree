<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial">Isaacs and Related Families of Kentucky</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">by Janice Allen Faulconer</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">My great grandmother, Emily Jeanetta Jones Isaacs started doing
genealogy long before I was born.&nbsp; She didn't have a lot of resources but she wrote a
lot of letters.&nbsp; It is because of her efforts we have information on our Jones,
Isaacs, Robbins, Clemons and other families that would have been lost otherwise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As I began to do research on my Isaacs family in Kentucky, I quickly
realized that virtually every Isaacs/Isaacks/Isaac family in the state between the
years 1790 and 1900 were
related.&nbsp; In order to correctly piece together one Isaacs family it was necessary to
piece together several other Isaacs families.&nbsp; Before long I had accumulated
information on most of the Isaacs families in Kentucky and many related families as
well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As another Isaacs researcher told me, &quot;Genealogy is always a
work in progress, never a finished product.&quot;&nbsp; So please help me continue this
work.&nbsp; If you see errors, e-mail me with corrections, if you have information I don't
have, please share.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have tried to include every Isaacs family who appeared on the 1790
through 1880 censuses of Kentucky.&nbsp; I have also included many related families. &nbsp;
But the inclusion of related families is totally arbitrary; well it's not actually
arbitrary, but it might seem so to an observer.&nbsp; Do not assume that because I
included one Harrison family or Bowman family that I have included all families of that
surname.&nbsp; If a family does not appear on my census extract, please do not assume that
family is not listed in the census of a particular county.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have chosen to present the families as they occur on the
original census, rather than in alphabetical order.&nbsp; I think it is an important research tool to know where these
families lived in relation to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried to be honest to the text of the census.&nbsp;
If the census lists Fielding Isaacs as Fielden Isaacks, so have I.&nbsp; So
please remember to check variant spellings.&nbsp; The best way to search for a
name is to use the&nbsp; &quot;find on this page&quot; function listed
under the edit button on the tool bar.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It would be wrong for me to claim this work as solely my
own.&nbsp; I could never have compiled this information without the help of many
Isaacs researchers.&nbsp; Stan Isaac, Aaron Isaacs, Susan Isaac, Ran Raider and
Geneva Rudolph have all provided me with valuable information.&nbsp; A
special thanks to Barry Isaacs whose knowledge of Isaacs in the military is inexhaustible.&nbsp;
His editing skills aren't bad either.&nbsp; And finally&nbsp; to all those of you who have answered
queries, mailed information with never a thought of re-imbursement, trekked
through cemeteries, and devoted hours of your time researching in county
courthouses, libraries and historical societies, thank you.</font></p>
