<P align="center"><strong> <font size="5"> John P. Hunter and Ruth P.Gennett/Jennett</font></strong></P>

<P>According to his Revolutionary War pension application, John P. Hunter married Ruth Gennett about 15 July 1786 in Fluvanna
County, Virginia.&nbsp;
There is some confusion about the marriage date because several different dates
were given in various depositions.&nbsp; However, this date seemed the most
likely. I haven't found a copy of the marriage certificate yet.&nbsp;John Hunter
was the son of Samuel P. Hunter (see Ann Avery Hunter's comments below) and Ruth
was the daughter of Thomas Gennett.&nbsp; Ruth appeared on the 1850 census of
Madison County as 85 years old and a native of Virginia.&nbsp; According to
pension records Ruth died 10 June 1858 in Madison County.
</P>

<P>(From Ann Avery Hunter, a Hunter researcher)
</P>

<blockquote>

<P>John P. and Forrest P. Hunter were the sons of Samuel Powell.&nbsp; Samuel's legal name was Samuel Powell, but he seems to have used the Hunter name in daily
life.&nbsp; He was enumerated in one Goochland Co. tax list as Samuel P. Hunter, however his deeds and his will name him as Samuel Powell. He also
witnessed several documents for [the] Hunter family as Samuel Powell. By the
time his two sons grew up, they had apparently used the Hunter name long
enough that it was accepted in Court as their legal name, but both
continued to use the initial "P" as a middle initial. John P. moved to
Madison Co., KY, while Forrest P. stayed in Goochland Co. Samuel Powell
names his two sons in his will as John and Forrest, and there is no doubt
that these are Samuel P. Hunter, John P. Hunter, and Forrest P. Hunter.
</P>

<P>The land records of Goochland Co. seem to support this theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

a public house in Goochland Co, VA on the Great Road from Staunton to Richmond. I was at said Hunter's fathers
according to the best of my recollection 1777 when said Hunter enlisted as a regular soldier into the
service. I was frequently at his fathers during the Revolution after John Hunter enlisted and always understood he was out in the
army, I understood from his father's family. In 1780 I was out in the militia and&nbsp;
was at his father's and saw John Hunter who had just returned from the army. I have known John Hunter from that time to this.&nbsp;</p>
