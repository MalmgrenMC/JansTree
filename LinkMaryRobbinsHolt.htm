<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Mary Robbins and Nathaniel Holt&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p>Mary Ann Robbins married Nathaniel Holt about 1835 or 1836 in Buncombe, North
Carolina.&nbsp; Mary Ann Robbins was born about 1813 in Randolph County, North
Carolina to Jonathan Robbins and Mary Masagee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Robbins'
family moved to Yancey County, North Carolina sometime about 1830.&nbsp; Her
mother, Mary Masagee Robbins appeared as a widow on the 1840 census in Yancy County,
NC.&nbsp; In 1850 Nathaniel Holt and his wife Mary Robbins were in Clay County, KY.&nbsp;
Mary Robbins Holt's mother, Mary Robbins was also in Clay County in 1850 living
with another daughter Abigail Robbins Ball
(mis-spelled Baugh on
the census), and next door to a son, Jacob Alexander Robbins.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Holt was born in Virginia in about 1813.&nbsp; His father,
Nathaniel Holt Sr. first appeared in North Carolina on the 1830 census of Buncombe
County.&nbsp; He was in Yancey County in 1840.&nbsp; Nathaniel
Holt Sr. was also in Clay County in 1850, living with a Lucy Holt, age 80.&nbsp;
I don't know the nature of the relationship of
Nathaniel Holt Sr. and Lucy Holt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of Nathaniel Holt Sr.'s daughters were
also living in Clay County in 1850, his daughter Ruth Holt who married Hosea
Holcombe and his daughter Mary Holt who married James Hampton. The vital records
of Clay County list children born to both of Nathaniel Holt Sr.'s daughters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clay Co. VR: Births: Henry Holcom born 26 April 1853, son of Hosea
Halcom and Ruthy Holt;  William J. Holcombe born 15 September
1855, son of Harvy Halcom and Ruthy Holt.</p>

<P>Clay Co.VR Births: James Hampton born 30 August 1853, G. W.
Hampton born 1 October 1855, and Robert
Hampton born November 1861, all sons of James Hampton and Mary
Eliza Holt.</P>

<P>Clay Co. VR: Deaths: Robert Hampton November 1861 aged 2 months, James Hampton, 8 October1853 of whooping cough, age 1
month, sons of James and Mary Hampton.
</blockquote>
<P>During the February 1859 term of the Jackson County Court, Nathaniel Holt
Senior was listed &quot;in bad circumstances as for living as is deemed a
pauper.&quot;&nbsp; In 1860 Nathaniel Holt Sr. was living with Charles and
Elizabeth Spivy.
<P>On the 4th day of the June term, 1865 of the Jackson County Circuit Court,
the Grand Jury indicted Nathaniel Holt [Jr.] for marking hogs.&nbsp; During the June
term, 1867, on the 3rd day of court, the case was dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>During the February term of the Jackson County Court, Mary Ann Holt sought an
allotment of dower.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jackson County Court, Feb term Feb 17<sup>th</sup>, 1868, p. 59</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Mary Ann Holt, plaintiff agst Nathaniel Holt hrs, defendants - petition for
  allotment of dower</p>
  <p>The defendants having been summoned according to law and failing to answer
  and the court being fully advised. It is therefore ordered that Robert E.
  Nichols, Andrew Cornelius and John Pennington be and they are hereby
  appointed this court’s commissioners to allot dower to the plaintiff, Mary
  Ann Holt, widow of Nathaniel Holt in and to the hands of the said Nathaniel
  Holt decd who will after being duly sworn allot the same and report to this
  court on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of its next March term until which this cause
  is continued.</p>
</blockquote>
<P> Mary Robbins Holt was listed as a widow on the 1870 census.&nbsp; She was living with her son, James O. Holt in
1880.
<P> <i>And interesting note:&nbsp; On the 1910 census Tenant Holt, the son of
Nathaniel Holt and Mary Robbins was living in Powell, Knox County, Tennessee,
two doors away from his first cousin Thomas J. Runions, the son of Thomas
Runions and Jane Robbins. Nathaniel and Mary Holt left North Carolina sometime
after 1840 and before 1850 and moved to Kentucky.&nbsp; Thomas and Jane Runions
left North Carolina about the same time and moved to McMinn County, Tennessee
for a few years, but then returned to North Carolina by 1860.&nbsp; So even
though by 1850, the families lived over 300 miles apart, they apparently kept in
contact with each other because it would be too much of a coincidence that their
children would be living two doors away from each other in an entirely different
state sixty years later.</i>
<P> &nbsp;
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Children of Nathaniel Holt and Mary Robbins</font></b></p>
<p><b>1. James Owen Holt</b> was born about 1837 in Yancey County, NC.&nbsp;&nbsp; James O.
Holt was indicted by the Grand July of the Jackson County Circuit Court, on the
3rd day of June term, 1866, for swearing.&nbsp; He plead not guilty and the
trial was set for the first day of the next term of the circuit court.&nbsp; The
cause was dismissed for want of prosecution on the 3rd day of the November term,
1866.&nbsp; He was single and living with his parents in 1870.&nbsp; He married
Eliza Edwards on 12 February 1874 in Jackson County.&nbsp; In 1886, James O.
Holt bought some land from Godfrey &amp; Lydia Isaacs:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Bk 5, Pg. 400 - 19 July 1886 Godfrey Isaacs and Lydia sold to James O. Holt
  for $25.00 a tract of land containing 50 acres situated on Bell Branch Waters
  of Rockcastle River to E. Faubus’ line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February, 1888, James O. Holt gave a deposition for his aunt, Matilda Robbins, his mother's
sister, in regard to Matilda's Civil War widow's pension application.</p>
<blockquote>
