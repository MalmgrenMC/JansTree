<p align="center"><b><font size="5">John Goldsmith and Elizabeth Marchbanks</font></b> </p>
<p>John Goldsmith&nbsp; was born about 1785 in Simpsonville, Greenville County,
South Carolina. He
was the son of William Goldsmith and Elizabeth Rountree.&nbsp; John Goldsmith
married Elizabeth Marchbanks, the daughter of Stephen Marchbanks about 1805 most likely in
Greenville County, South Carolina.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
John and Elizabeth Goldsmith bought land in Buncombe County, North Carolina
sometime in the 1820's with the intent to homestead. (<i>Madison County
Heritage, North Carolina Vol 1</i>, #279, Goldsmith). John died sometime before
1830 when Elizabeth Goldsmith was listed in Buncombe County, NC. as the head of the
household.&nbsp; Since John was buried in South Carolina, there is some question
regarding whether he and Elizabeth both moved to North Carolina, or if she and
the children moved after his death.
 </p>
<p>
I have seen lots of speculation that John and Elizabeth were married about
1811.&nbsp; But to assume that one has to wonder about the identity of the older children
living with John and Elizabeth in the 1820 census.&nbsp; There were three
children between the ages of 10 and 16 in the household.&nbsp; If we compare the 1820 and 1830
censuses with what we know from the 1850 and 1860 censuses ( I have ignored the
1840 because I haven't found Elizabeth on&nbsp; that census) it is clear that we
know very little about the family of John and Elizabeth Goldsmith.&nbsp; But both the 1820 and the 1830 suggest an earlier marriage date than 1811,
most likely as early as 1805 or 1806.

<p>On February 26<sup>th</sup>, 1832 (Yancey Co. Court Records) two of the
children of John and Elizabeth Goldsmith were bound out.&nbsp; &quot;Matilda
Goldsmith is bound to Reuben Keith until she is 18. He is to teach her the art
and mysteries of industry. John Goldsmith is bound to Reuben Keith until age
21.&quot;&nbsp; I think Reuben Keith might have been a relative, but I have yet to find
a connection.&nbsp; Some researchers have suggested that Elizabeth Goldsmith
married Reuben Keith.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 1850 census of Buncombe County, Reuben
Keith was listed as an 81 year old laborer who was born in Virginia.&nbsp; He was
married to an Elizabeth who was 70 years old and born in North Carolina.&nbsp; I don't think this
was Elizabeth Goldsmith who would have been approximately 60, and born in South
Carolina.&nbsp; When Matilda Goldsmith Robbins applied for a pension for her
husband's Civil War service, she said that she was married at the home of her
brother, William Goldsmith, on 12 October 1841 in Buncombe County.&nbsp; Maybe
she didn't marry at her mother's house because her mother was deceased at the
time.&nbsp; She also said that she couldn't produce a copy of her marriage
certificate because the records had been destroyed in the war, and the minister
had since gone insane.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>A record of the probate of William Goldsmith was listed in <i>A Collection of
Upper Couth Carolina Genealogical and Family Records</i> Vol I, pg. 151: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estate of William Goldsmith Senr 22 March 1834, Greenville, South Carolina, widow:
Elizabeth&nbsp;<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
    The same source listed the children of John Goldsmith as Elizabeth, Milley,
    Massey, Turner and Mariah.&nbsp; We know this has to be an incomplete list
    because his son William was not mentioned and we know William was still alive in
    1834.&nbsp; This record is a transcription of original records that I
    haven't seen.&nbsp; A lot of research needs to be done.
 </p>
<p>
    Some Court records from Buncombe County list Goldsmiths, I don't know how or
    if these Goldsmiths relate to our John and Elizabeth Goldsmith.

February term 1839&nbsp;<br>
State vs James Bradley - case of bastardy&nbsp;<br>
    James Bradley, the reputed father of an illegitimate child begotten on the body of
Lucy Goldsmith, appears in court and entered into bond for $300 with Nathan Anderson and Reze Jarvis,
securities to indemnify the county for said child becoming a charge on said county.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Thursday, October 14, 1841&nbsp;<br>
    Ordered by the Court that the sheriff bring into court John Goldsmith, illegitimate son of Elizabeth
Goldsmith that the court may prove to bind or otherwise provide for him that the cost
    may not come chargeable to the county.&nbsp;&nbsp; (We do know that this John
was not the son
    of John Goldsmith and Elizabeth Marchbanks, as he would be 15 or 16 at
    the time, too old for the county to worry about his support.&nbsp; It also
    seems unlikely that this Elizabeth is the child of John Goldsmith and
    Elizabeth Marchbanks because Elizabeth Goldsmith married Alexander Bradley
    prior to 1836.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Spring term, 1849&nbsp;<br>
    The petition of William Goldsmith and others praying the court to lay off a road on the Bullcreek
road between William A. Peck and the top of the hill towards James Ray to the Buncombe County
line near John West be received and advertised.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Wed, April 18, 1849&nbsp;<br>

    <b><font size="4">Children of John Goldsmith and Elizabeth Marchbanks</font></b>
 </p>
<p align="left">The 1820 and 1830 censuses suggest there John Goldsmith and
Elizabeth Marchbanks were probably the parents of about 11
children.&nbsp; I can only identify five.
 </p>
<p align="left"><b>1. William M. Goldsmith </b> was born about 1812 in Greenville, South
Carolina.&nbsp; He married first, Mary Buckner, daughter of Jesse Buckner.&nbsp;
William married a 2nd time to Mary Ann McMahon on 26 September 1855 in Madison
County, North Carolina.&nbsp;&nbsp; William Goldsmith, along with his son John
A. Goldsmith served in the Confederate Army North Carolina Troops, Company 64<sup>th</sup>
Regiment. William died at Camp Douglas, Illinois, in a Northern prison camp.
 </p>
<p align="left">
    <b>
    2. Elizabeth Goldsmith</b> was born sometime between 1815&nbsp; and 1820 (she
    was listed as 35 in 1850 and 40 in 1860).&nbsp; The Antioch
    Cemetery, Barnardsville, Buncombe County, North Carolina.&nbsp; listed her birth as 5 June 1818
    and death as 24 September 1909. (Antioch Cemetery information courtesy
    of David Gregg.)&nbsp; Elizabeth married
    Alexander Bradley about 1834.&nbsp; Some family records listed Alexander as
    James Alexander Bradley.&nbsp; Alexander Bradley was born 9 May 1813 and
    died 28 July 1891, he too was buried in the Antioch Cemetery in Buncombe
    County, North Carolina.

    3. <a href="LinkJARobbins.htm"> Matilda Lucinda Goldsmith</a> </b> was born 28 July 1824 in Greenville
    County, South Carolina. She married Jacob Alexander Robbins on 12 October
    1841 at the home of her brother, William Goldsmith, in Yancey County, North
    Carolina.&nbsp; Family records list
her marriage date as 12 October 1841. However on one of the depositions she gave
    on the pension application of her husband,
    Jacob Alexander Robbins, she listed the marriage date as 12 October 1842.&nbsp;
    But on all later depositions,
    she consistently listed the date of the marriage as 12 October 1841.&nbsp; Her sister in law Abigail Ball
    also listed the date of the marriage as 12 October 1841.&nbsp; I think the
    1841 date is correct and Matilda simply made a mistake on her first
    deposition for a Civil War pension.

    about the 12<sup>th</sup> day of October 1842 at William Goldsmiths in the
    County of Buncombe in the State of North Carolina by Robert Paterson,
    Preacher, and that she knows of no record evidence of said marriage that she
    has been informed that the records was destroyed in time of the war that the
    preacher is gone distracted, but she can prove the marriage by eye
    witnesses.

    In a deposition on the 4th of October 1888, Lucinda said:
 </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I was married to deceased soldier October 12, 1841. I had thirteen children
  by him, four of them were still born. I had a record of their births, but is
  was burned about 16 years ago last February. Eight of said children were
  living when my husband died. One of my children, James Wilburn Robbins, was a
  soldier in 24<sup>th</sup> Kentucky Vols and died in service. The eight who
  were living when my husband died were:</p>

    &nbsp;I am 60 years old, and the widow of J.A. Robbins.  My P.O. is Moore's Creek, Jackson, KY.  I have known Addison Ball from the time we were both children, we were second cousins.  My husband Alex Robbins was Mrs. Abigail A. Ball's brother, we were all raised together on the waters of Little Ivy , Buncombe Co. NC.  I was not present at the marriage, but I remember when they were married.

    Matilda died on the 15th of October, 1903.&nbsp; Some family members say she
    died at the home of her brother John Goldsmith in Oklahoma.&nbsp;I haven't
    found Matilda on the 1900 census, so I am not sure about this information.<br>

    <b>
    4. John Goldsmith</b> was born 10 July of either 1824, 1825 or 1826 probably in
    Greenville, South Carolina, although he listed North Carolina as his place of birth on the 1850
    census.&nbsp; I have seen all three years listed for his birth.&nbsp; If our
    family records are correct regarding the birth date of Matilda Lucinda
    Goldsmith, it is highly unlikely that John was born in July of 1824, unless
    they were twins.&nbsp; Matilda's pension depositions as well as the census
    seem to support her birth date as 28 July 1824.&nbsp; John married Naoma Bryan Corn 1 August
                        1846 in North Carolina. He died 12 Dec 1911 in Beckham
    County, Oklahoma.&nbsp; Naoma was born 2 April 1832 in North Carolina and
