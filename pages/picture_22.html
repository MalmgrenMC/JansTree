      <i>Picture #22 in album:</i> My grandfather told me that this picture and
      #21 were &quot;old maid aunts&quot; of his father. Because of the&nbsp;
      similarities, it is most likely that #21 and #22 were taken at the Sam
      Glen Payne studio in Aylesbury.&nbsp; I don't know anything about Mrs.
      Ingham.</FONT>
