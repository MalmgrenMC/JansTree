<p ALIGN="center"><b><font size="5">Godfrey Isaacs and Keziah Johnson</font></b></p>
<p ALIGN="left">Godfrey Isaacs was born about 1793 in North Carolina.&nbsp; He
was the son of <a href="LinkSamuelNancy.htm"> Samuel Isaacs and Nancy Baldridge</a>.&nbsp; He married Keziah Johnson
on 20 February 1812, in Floyd County, KY.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left">20 Feb 1812 Godfrey Isaach and Patrick
Johnson are bondsmen for the marriage of Godfrey Isaachs and Keziah
Johnson.&nbsp; [I give my consent for my son to marry Keziah Johnson. 18 Feb
1812, Samuel Isaachs.]&nbsp; <i>Annals of Floyd County, Kentucky, pg. 132.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left"> Keziah was born about 1794 in Virginia or North
Carolina to Patrick and Delila Johnson.&nbsp; Both the Isaacs and Johnson families moved to Floyd
County from Virginia.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">There were two Godfrey Isaacs in Clay County in 1820.&nbsp; One
had four males under 10 and 2 females under 10 in the household.&nbsp; The other
had three males under 10 and 1 female under 10 in the household.&nbsp; The age
of the adult male and adult female in the household were the same.&nbsp; I think
these two Godfreys were probably the same person.&nbsp; There might have been a
counting error either the first or second time the children were counted, or
perhaps Keziah had twins between the visits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">If we assume that there was really only one Godfrey Isaacs in
Clay County, we still have to account for yet another Godfrey Isaacs who was also in
the 26 to 45 age group, but enumerated in Estill County on the 1820 Kentucky census.&nbsp; Distinguishing between these two
families has been difficult because both Godfreys generally lived in the same areas;
their children were about the same ages, and they seemed to both like the same
given names.&nbsp; It
helped when I discovered that the &quot;other&quot; Godfrey (Betsy)&nbsp; left considerable
property in Jackson County that was divided among his children after his
death.&nbsp; Knowing who didn't belong to Godfrey (Keziah)&nbsp; helped narrow the
field.&nbsp; The Godfrey who married Keziah Johnson was a nephew to the other Godfrey
(Betsy).&nbsp; The Godfrey who married Betsy Howard was a brother to Samuel Isaacs who
married Nancy Baldridge.&nbsp; Both Samuel and Godfrey (Betsy) were sons of yet another
Godfrey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">We don't know all the children of Godfrey Isaacs and Keziah
Johnson.&nbsp; On the 1860 census, Godfrey and Keziah had unmarried children Samuel (22) and
Rebecca (21) living with them.&nbsp; But these children were not listed on the
1850 census with their parents.&nbsp; However, they do seem to be accounted for on
the 1840 census of Laurel County which listed 1 male under 5 and one female under 5.&nbsp;
With the
help of another Isaacs researcher, we might have made some headway identifying
two other children of Godfrey and Keziah's.&nbsp; [See the discussion of Godfrey and Keziah's children below.] &nbsp; If we
look at the 1820 and 1830 censuses we find additional children we have not
identified.&nbsp; However, those that were under 5 in one census year and were
not listed in the next census year, were most likely, but not necessarily, deceased.&nbsp;
It would be
nice to have a family bible surface somewhere to answer all our questions.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Godfrey and Keziah, as well as their children Andrew, Rebecca
and Samuel all died in September 1863 of typhoid fever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><b><font size="4">Children of Godfrey Isaacs and Keziah Johnson</font></b></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><b>1. <a href="LinkJacobRebecca.htm"> Jacob Isaacs</a> </b> was born about 1813.&nbsp; He married
Rebecca Bowman, the daughter of Jacob Bowman and Elander Evans on 9 August 1832
in Clay County.&nbsp; Jacob married 2nd Sarah Landrum about 1863.&nbsp; He died
July 1877 in Williamstown, Grant County.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left"><b>2. <a href="LinkIsaacIsaacs.htm"> Isaac Isaacs</a> </b> was born about 1815.&nbsp; He married
Vicy
Triplett on 23 February 1834 in Floyd County.&nbsp;They had one son, Linville, who was born about 1835. Vicy deserted Isaac
after two years of marriage.&nbsp;The divorce
papers are in the Kentucky State Archives in Box 208, Bundle 415.&nbsp; The year
1836 is written on the outside of the bundle.&nbsp; That date coincides with the
date that Vicy supposedly deserted Isaac.&nbsp; However the divorce was not
granted until Tuesday, 24 March 1857.&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">While she was doing some original research in Laurel County
several years ago, Susan Isaac, an Isaacs researcher, found a marriage bond for Isaac Isaacs and Susannah
Huff dated 6 September 1841, that had been misfiled. &nbsp;I don't know if an actual marriage took place since there
wasn't a marriage return
recorded.&nbsp; (However, the absence of a return is not uncommon.)&nbsp; Isaac
Isaacs and Susan Huff had at least twelve children between the years 1839 and
1862.&nbsp; I have no
idea if Isaac and Susan were ever legally married.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isaac Isaacs died prior to November 1869, when his son Andrew Isaacs was appointed administrator of
his estate.&nbsp; Susan was listed as a widow on the 1870 census of Jackson
County.</p>
<p><b>3.&nbsp; <a href="LinkAndrewLucinda.htm">Andrew Isaacs</a> </b> was born about 1819.&nbsp; He married 1st Mahaly
Lakes/Lax, daughter of Carter Lakes/Lax and Edy Skinner, on 27 April 1840 in
Estill County.&nbsp; She must have died soon afterwards, because he married
Lucinda Carpenter 28 September 1841 in Laurel County.&nbsp; Lucinda was the
daughter of <a href="LinkStephenCarpenter.htm"> Stephen Carpenter and Nancy
Walker</a>.&nbsp; Andrew served during the
Civil War in Company A, 47th KY Volunteer (Mounted) Infantry as a 2nd
Lieutenant.&nbsp; He died on 2 September, 1863 in Jackson County of typhoid fever. An account of Andrew's
death, as well as that of his parents and brother and sister was given in a deposition
by Elizabeth Truett, on behalf of his brother, Godfrey, who had
also served in the Civil War.&nbsp; The complete account&nbsp; is listed under the Godfrey and
Lydia Isaacs link.&nbsp; This is an excerpt from Elizabeth Truett's deposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left">    Question:  Did you wait on any of his [Godfrey Jr.'s]
father's family in their last sickness and death,
if so state which of them you waited on and in what order they died giving the name of each
and about how long between their deaths.<br>
<br>
    Answer:  I did wait on them, but I cannot state what year it was or whether it was before
the war or not.  I waited on Andrew first, then his mother, Aunt Kizzy, then Becky her
daughter, then Samuel another son and then old man Godfrey.  They all died, I think it was in
the latter part of the summer and beginning of the fall.  They all died the same fall.
Andrew first, then the mother and daughter in one day and Sam soon after.  The mother,
daughter and Sam were all hauled off for burial at once, and shortly after that his father
died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left">    
Funeral services for Andrew were held in the Annville Baptist Church in Laurel County.&nbsp; Andrew is
buried in the Annville Cemetery.&nbsp; Lucinda received a pension for Andrew's
Civil War service.&nbsp; She died 25 April 1873, in Jackson County.&nbsp; Two of her
children,&nbsp; Mary and Lydia were minors at that time.&nbsp; Their uncle,
Godfrey Isaacs was appointed their guardian.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">    
Jackson County Court Records, May term, 1873:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p. 379 On the motion of Godfrey Isaacs ordered that he be appointed guardian
to the minor children of Andrew and Lucinda Isaacs, decd. to wit: Godfrey Isaacs
administrator of estate of Lucinda Isaacs decd, her son John waiving the right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left" style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>4. Rhoda Isaacs</b> was born about
1824.  She married James Hillard on 13 April 1842 in Laurel
County.&nbsp; I can't find her on the 1850 census, but she and James were listed
on the 1860, 1870 and 1880 Jackson
County censuses. During the June 1863 term of the Jackson County Court, the
Commonwealth brought charges against James and Rhoda Hillard, and it was ordered
that the cause be continued.&nbsp; The records don't indicate what those charges
were.&nbsp; The cause was again continued during the June 1864 and the November
1864 sessions. During the June term, 1865 the Commonwealth brought separate
charges against James Hillard to which he plead guilty and was fined
$2.50.&nbsp; The cause against James and Rhoda Hillard was again continued.
During the November 1866 term the defendants were granted separate trials.</p>
<p>p. 477 Commonwealth plaintiff against James &amp; Rhoda Hellard,
defendant&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>On motion of James Hellard, defendant, separate trial granted, defendant
  James Hellard waived an arraignment and plead not guilty whereupon came the
  following jury...[who rendered the] verdict, &quot;We of the jury find the
  defendant guilty and sentence him to the penitentiary for the term of one
  year. When upon he was remanded to jail.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left" style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">During
the April 1878 term of the Court, James Hillard was found not guilty of house
burning.&nbsp; During the April 1880 term of the Court Robert Jones sued James
Hillard for non-payment.&nbsp; Apparently James Hillard bought a piece of
property from Robert and Polly Jones on the waters of Big Clover Bottom Creek,
that was bordered by some trees on Robert Jones' current property and continued
to the fence of James Hilliard's property.&nbsp; The court decided that James
Hillard did owe the Jones' the money and he was ordered to pay.</p>

5.<a href="LinkGodfreyLydia.htm">Godfrey Isaacs</a> </b> was born about 1825.&nbsp; He married Lydia Morris in Owsley
County in about 1846. Lydia was the daughter of George Morris and Elizabeth
Johnson.&nbsp; Godfrey served during the Civil War in Company D, 7th KY
Volunteer Infantry, as a 2nd Lieutenant, and in Company A, 47th KY Volunteer
(Mounted) Infantry as a 1st Lieutenant.&nbsp;Godfrey was granted an invalid
pension for his Civil War service in 1875.&nbsp; Some of his neighbors conspired
to have his pension revoked, claiming that his illness was not the result of a
disease contracted during the war, but rather the result of hereditary
frailties. The pension was revoked in 1877, but after a special investigation,
it was re-instated.&nbsp; The special investigator called the conspirators
ignorant and mean spirited.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Godfrey's father and mother, Godfrey and Keziah, as well as his
older brother Andrew, younger brother Samuel, and younger sister Rebecca, all
died in 1864. Godfrey Isaacs Jr. was appointed the executor of his father's
estate, and later the guardian of his brother Andrew's minor children..&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Jacob Isaacs.&nbsp; <i>Grant Co. Bond Book, 1847-1855 pg. 147</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left"> Elisha
must have had an accident or gotten sick, because the <i>Grant Co. Order Book
C., p. 649</i>, dated Oct 1855 lists claims against the Grant County Court for services rendered:&nbsp;
...to J.A. Johnson for medical attention to the widow Milton and to
John J. Hicks, and to Elisha Isaacs<i>.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="left">On the 1860 census, Amanda was again listed as a widow.&nbsp;<i> Abstracted
County Records</i> by Janet Pease list Amanda's death, &quot; Amanda Isaacs, 79,
white female, died 17 August 1898 of stomach trouble and old age, widowed, housekeeper, born in Grant.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp; **I am not completely sure that Elisha was a son of Godfrey and
Keziah.&nbsp; But at this point it seems to be the &quot;best
guess.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left"><b>7. Eleanor Isaacs</b> was born between 1830 and 1832.&nbsp; She married James
H. Collins on the 8th of April 1850 in Laurel
County.&nbsp; The vital records of Laurel County show that they had a son
Harden on 6 February 1852; a daughter Mahala on 1 December 1853; and a daughter
Rebecca on 4 December 1855.&nbsp; The vital records of Jackson County show they
had a son James F. on 10 April 1858.&nbsp; They appeared on the 1860 census of
Jackson County, but I can't find them on the 1870 census.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">On the 6th of June, 1885, Nelly (Isaacs) Collins, while living
in Dwarf, Perry County, applied for a Civil War pension on behalf of her
deceased husband's service, but was rejected. Evidently there were several
problems with her application.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dates on the application (in
1885) differed from the vital records and the county marriage
record.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She listed her marriage as the 9th of April 1853 in
Jackson County, but a deposition from the Laurel County clerk included in the
application listed the marriage as&nbsp; the 8th of April 1850 in Laurel
County.&nbsp; She listed the children's birth dates as:</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Hardin - 16 February 1854<br>
Mahala - 3 December 1856<br>
Rebecca E. - 1 December 1858<br>
James Dilliard (not F. as listed in the vital records) - 9 April 1860<br>
Samuel J. as 9 August 1862</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The Kentucky vital records ended in about 1860 so we didn't find
a record of the birth of Samuel J. Collins.&nbsp; But I would imagine that he
was probably born in 1860 or 1861.&nbsp; On the 1880 census (Perry County) he
listed his age as 20. Samuel was listed on the census as maimed, crippled,
bedridden or otherwise disabled.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In addition to the problem with the dates, Nelly listed her
husband as having been a private in Co. C, commanded by John Wilson of the 8th
Regiment of Kentucky Infantry.&nbsp; She explained that he was furloughed on the
1st of October 1863 because he had typhoid fever and he came home.&nbsp; He died
on the 15th of October, 1863 in Jackson County. Apparently the James Collins who
had served in that company was alive and already receiving a pension in another
county.&nbsp; She thought her husband might have served under the name James
Hudson since he sometimes used that as an alias, but the description of James
Hudson didn't match her husband.&nbsp; She did find a different James Collins
that she felt was most likely her husband, but apparently this James Collins was
listed as deserted, not furloughed.&nbsp; I assume at this point Nelly was disillusioned
enough that she didn't fight anymore.&nbsp; She never received a pension.<br>
<br>
 <i>Jackson County Court Records, February term, 1864, p. 376</i>.&nbsp;
Nelly Collins produced a note (on 24 January 1864, the same day her brother
Godfrey produced his note) from her father, Godfrey Isaacs Sr., that if she
would take care of him as long as he lived, he would give her his worldly goods
for her own use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In 1880 Nelly Collins was living with her daughter Mahala and
her son in law Lewis Holiday in Perry County.&nbsp; Nelly's son Samuel was
living with them and designated disabled.&nbsp; A Martha Collins, age 10 was
also living with them, but I am not sure of her relationship.</p>

found Rhoda on the 1850, but she is 35 on the 1860, 45 on the 1870 and 57 on the
1880.&nbsp; It is possible that they were twins, more likely that they were born very close in age to each other.&nbsp; It is also a
fact that in the 1800's people did not keep tract of their age as diligently as
we do today.&nbsp; Since, with only the records I have available, it would be
impossible for me to know the true birth order of these Isaacs children, I have
simply assigned them an age, trying to conform to the information available.</i>

<p ALIGN="center"><b><font size="3">Barry Isaacs' analysis of the land records
concerning Godfrey and Keziah</font></b>
</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Godfrey and Keziah began by purchasing a Land Grant on Beaver
Creek in Floyd County that was surveyed in March 1825.&nbsp; They continued
buying land through September 1831.&nbsp; Beginning in February 1834 they were
selling land on Beaver Creek.&nbsp; They continued selling land in Floyd County
on Beaver Creek through November 1839.&nbsp; The Right and Left Forks of Beaver
Creek form just south of Martin in present day Floyd County.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
According to federal censuses Godfrey &amp; Keziah were in Clay in 1820 &amp;
1830, Estill in 1840 and Laurel in 1840 &amp; 1850.&nbsp; I think it is rather
obvious that many of the 1820 &amp; 1830 Clay census records were actually for
residents of Floyd.&nbsp; I do believe Godfrey (&amp; Keziah) moved closer to
his Uncle Godfrey (&amp; Betsy) in Estill in time for the 1840 census.<br>
