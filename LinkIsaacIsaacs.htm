<p ALIGN="center"><b><font size="5">Isaac Isaacs and Vicy Triplett and Susannah Huff</font></b></p>
<p ALIGN="left">Isaac Isaacs was born about 1815 to <a href="LinkGodfreyKeziah.htm"> Godfrey Isaacs and Keziah
Johnson</a>.&nbsp; He married Vicy
Triplett on 23 February 1834 in Floyd County&nbsp; (<i>Floyd County Kentucky Courthouse
Marriage Records)</i>.<i> </i> They had one son, Linville, who was born about 1835.
According to court documents, Vicy deserted Isaac
and their son Linville after two years of marriage.&nbsp; Isaac filed for a divorce at some point.&nbsp; The divorce
papers were found in the Kentucky State Archives in Box 208, Bundle 415.&nbsp; The year
1836 was written on the outside of the bundle.&nbsp; That date coincides with the
date that Vicy supposedly deserted Isaac.&nbsp; However the divorce was not
granted until Tuesday, 24 March 1857.&nbsp;</p>
<p>28 May 1856 - Deposition of Godfrey Isaacs taken at the examiners office of
Thomas Owens in Richmond, KY.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am acquainted with Isaac Isaacs and Vicy Isaacs. Isaac is said to be my
son. Isaac and Vicy were married in Floyd County in KY sometime upwards of
twenty years ago. I reckon they lived together as man and wife something like
two years. So far as I know they lived together about two years, and Vicy Isaacs
then went off and left her husband Isaac and as I understand went to North
Carolina and has never lived with him since. She took up with another man after
her separation with Isaac, and had several children. Isaac Isaacs was born and
raised in this state and now lives in Madison county. He has never lived out of
the state of KY They have never been together so far as I know since the
separation and I have had every opportunity to know whether they have or not.
– Godfrey Isaacs</p>
<p>The deposition of Godfrey's is followed by a short note by James Isaacs Sr.
(brother of Isaac)</p>
<p>I know that Isaac and Vicey Isaacs lived together as man and wife for about
the time spoken of in Godfrey Isaacs deposition above.&nbsp; I think she went
off and left hem abut the time Godfrey states and has never lived with him
since.&nbsp; I saw Vicey where she started to go off. - James Isaacs</p>
<p>[A special thanks to Geneva Rudolph for providing the divorce information
regarding Isaac Isaacs and Vicy Triplett.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left"> There was a marriage bond in Laurel County
dated 6 September 1841 for the marriage of Isaac Isaacs and Susannah Huff.&nbsp;
I don't know if an actual marriage took place since technically Isaac was still
married to Vicy Triplett at the time, and there was no return
recorded.&nbsp; (However, the absence of a return is not uncommon.)&nbsp; Isaac
Isaacs and Susan Huff had twelve children between the years 1839 and
1862.&nbsp; There is a puzzling vital record in Madison County that is worth
noting:</p>
<p>Born: Mahala Isaacs, daughter of Isaac Isaacs and Visey Triplet, 9 October
1852 in Madison.&nbsp; Parents reside in Madison.</p>
<p>Since Vicy had left Kentucky and moved to North Carolina years earlier, it seems
unlikely that she, rather than Susan Huff, would be the mother of Mahala.&nbsp; On the 1860 census Mahala
was living with Isaac and Susan.&nbsp;
Perhaps, since Isaac was not actually divorced at this time, he and Susan
decided to list Vicy as the parent for some legal reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;1852 was the first year Kentucky required vital records to be taken by the
counties.&nbsp; The act was repealed in 1862 because of the War.&nbsp; The new
law might have made Jacob and Susan nervous because of their marital status.&nbsp;
Isaac and Susan seemed to have avoided the vital record recorders after 1852,
because there was no vital records listing for their children William Riley born
about 1855, Lorenzo Dow born about 1858 and Anderson born in 1860.&nbsp; I have no
idea if Isaac and Susan were ever legally married.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the November 1868 term of the Jackson County Circuit Court, Isaac
Isaacs was paid $4.00 by the commonwealth for killing a fox.<i> (Jackson County
Circuit Court, pg. 112)</i>&nbsp; Isaac must have died shortly after that,
because on the1st of November, 1869, Isaac's son Andrew Isaacs&nbsp; was &quot;appointed
administrator of the estate of Isaac Isaacs dec'd with David
Gentry and R. Gentry and A.C. Lainhard to appraise the estate of Isaac Isaacs.&quot;&nbsp;
(<i>Jackson County Court Records, pg. 323</i>)</p>
<p>The surviving heirs of Isaac Isaacs were listed in the Jackson County Land
Records, Book 2, pg 362:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>21 April 1871 Kiah Crooke and Sally his wife and Joel Gentry and Thomas W.
Cox and Rhoda his wife in Estill on one part and Isaac Isaacs heirs on the other
part:</p>
<p>Widow, Susan Isaacs. Children: Linville Isaacs, Nathan Pearson the only child
of his mother Elizabeth Pearson the late Elizabeth Isaacs, Patsy Abner, the late
Patsy Isaacs, Andrew Isaacs, Godfrey Isaacs, John Isaacs, Mary Jane Cain, late
Mary Jane Isaacs, Nancy Jane Collins, late Nancy Jane Isaacs, Mahala Jane
Lainhart, late Mahala Isaacs, William Riley Isaacs, Lorenzo Dow Isaacs, Anderson
Isaacs and Cassius Isaacs all of Jackson County. KY except Patsy Abner of
Fleming County. KY,</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Children of Isaac Isaacs and Vicy Triplett</font></b></p>
<p>Apparently the only child Isaac Isaacs and Vicy Triplett had was Linville
Isaacs.&nbsp; According to Carol Cain, <i>Tripping Down the Triplett Path</i>,
Linville was born in April of 1838 in Estill County.&nbsp;&nbsp;Linville listed
April 1838 as his month and year of birth on the 1900 census.&nbsp; But,
according to the court records, Vicy deserted her son and husband in about 1836,
Linville was probably born in about April 1835.&nbsp; He was listed as 35 on the
1870 census and 45 on the 1880 census.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Linville married Elizabeth Hisel on 7 August 1854 in Estill County.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson
County Circuit Court Records list Linville and Elizabeth's divorce proceedings beginning in
1864 the the divorce finalized
in 1866. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Elizabeth Isaacs, plaintiff against Linville Isaacs, defendant</p>
  <p>&quot;It is ordered by the court that the plaintiff be and she is hereby
  divorced from the dependant and restored to all the rights and privileges of
  an unmarried woman and that defendant also be divorced from the plaintiff and
  restored to all the rights and privileges of an unmarried man after the expiration
  of one year from this date. It is further adjudged that the defendant pay the
  costs of this action and the same is ordered to be stricken from this
  docket.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linville married a second time to Elizabeth Azbill on 20 May 1870 in Jackson
County.&nbsp; According to Loretta Turner, Linville went to live with his son
Irvine in Illinois and died while there in 1927.&nbsp; He is buried in While Oak
Cemetery in Carlock, McLean County, Illinois. </p>
<p>On various family history sites, I have seen Linville referred to as William
Linville.&nbsp; But I have
never seen &quot;William&quot; on any documents, official or unofficial.&nbsp; He never
used William on the census, in land records, in marriage or bond records, or on
court records.&nbsp; The name William Linville never appeared on probate records
regarding Linville.&nbsp; Yet, in spite of this, many family historians continue to use the name William Linville. It is interesting how easy it is to
add undocumented information and how hard it is to get rid of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>1. Elizabeth Isaacs</b> was born about 1839 in Laurel County.&nbsp; She married
Richard M. Pearson on 13 December 1860 in Jackson County.&nbsp; Elizabeth died prior
to 1864 when her husband Richard remarried.&nbsp; In 1870, Nathan Pearson the 9
year old son of Richard and Elizabeth was living with his widowed grandmother
Susannah Huff.&nbsp; Nathan's father, Richard Pearson and his second wife and their three children
were also living in Jackson County in 1870.&nbsp; </p>

a private in
Company D of the 7th KY Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War. He married
Deborah Isaacs, the daughter of&nbsp; John Isaacs and Isabella Moore in about 1867.&nbsp; He was appointed the administrator of his

cutting timber on government lands.&nbsp; Deborah applied for a widow's pension
on the 15th of September 1905 while in Arkansas.&nbsp; In February of 1911,

  them were ever previously married, and that they lived together as husband and
  wife until her death in June 1882, and that no divorce was ever applied for or
  granted to either of them.&nbsp; Godfrey M. Isaacs was my brother and I

  about ten years.&nbsp; The last time I ever saw Godfrey M. Isaacs and his wife
