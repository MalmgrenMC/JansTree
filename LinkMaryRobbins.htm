<P align="center"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> <font size="5"> Jonathan
Robbins and Mary Masagee/Massingale</font></span></strong></P>

<P>Jonathan Robbins was born about 1785 in Randolph County, North Carolina.&nbsp; It is speculated that he
was the son of James Robbins and Martha
Beasley.&nbsp; Some researchers say he was the son of James Robbins and Martha
Brothers, and others say that there is no evidence even linking&nbsp; Jonathan
to James.&nbsp; Most of the information we have on these early Robbins comes
from W.T. Robbins, in <i>History of Bell County Kentucky</i>.&nbsp; Some of
what he said has been verified by censuses, marriage and other records, but not
all.&nbsp; We don't know what his sources were and therefore there is no way for
us to judge the accuracy of his account.&nbsp; The Robbins research is complicated by the fact that there are a preponderance
of Robbins in Randolph County, and as one Robbins researcher, Sarah Robbins
Lehman said, &quot;It was well into the middle of the 19th century before the Robbins
learned they could marry
anyone but cousins.&quot;&nbsp;</P>

<P>James Robbins married Mary Masagee on 23 August 1804 in Randolph County,
NC.&nbsp; Some family members say that her name was actually Mary Massingale and
that her father was Lemuel.&nbsp; We haven't been able to prove or disprove
that.&nbsp; But we do know
that somewhere along the way Jonathan and Mary moved to Buncombe or Yancey
County.&nbsp; In her CW pension deposition, Abigail, the daughter of Jonathan
and Mary, said that her mother lived
so close to the line between Buncombe and Yancey she couldn't remember in which
county they actually lived at any given time.&nbsp; Mary appeared as the head of the household on
the 1840 Yancey County census, so we assume that Jonathan died before that time.&nbsp; Mary
moved to Kentucky sometime between 1840 and 1850 with several of her
children.&nbsp; In 1850 she was living in Clay County with her daughter Abigail
Ball (mis-spelled Baugh on the census.)&nbsp;&nbsp; She was also living next door to
the family of her son Jacob Alexander and her daughter Mary Holt.&nbsp; I
think she was the Mary A. who appeared in the
1860 census living with Absolam Robbins in Clay County, Kentucky.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure who this Absolam was,
perhaps her son Absolam,
but the dates are confusing.&nbsp; (See the discussion concerning Absolam,
below.).&nbsp; Mary didn't appear on
the 1870 census.</P>

<P><b>1. James M. Robbins</b> was born about 1806 in Randolph, North Carolina.&nbsp; He married Nancy Robbins 19 March
1827 in Randolph County, North Carolina.&nbsp;</P>

<P>James and Nancy settled in Harlan County, Kentucky before 1840.&nbsp; They
were in Harlan County in 1840 and1850.&nbsp; Nancy Robbins died prior to 1858
when James married Sarah C. Miracle.&nbsp; James and Sarah were in Harlan County
in 1860.&nbsp; They were living in Josh
Bell County in 1870.&nbsp; Josh Bell County was renamed &quot;Bell&quot; County
in 1873.&nbsp; James died about 1878 in Bell
County.&nbsp;Sarah Robbins was listed as a widow on the 1880 census of Bell
County.</P>

<P><b>2. Lemuel Robbins</b> was born about 1808 in Randolph County, North Carolina.&nbsp; He married Kiziah Robbins 15 December 1827
in Randolph County, North Carolina.&nbsp; She was the daughter of John Robbins
and Elizabeth Towery.</P>

<P>
Lemuel and Keziah moved to Harlan County, Kentucky soon after James.&nbsp; They
were in Harlan County in 1850 and 1860.&nbsp; They were in Josh Bell County in
1870.&nbsp; Lemuel died about 1878 in Bell
County, KY.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keziah was listed as a widow on the 1880 census of Bell
County.&nbsp; She was living with her daughter Sarah J. and her son in law James
Green and their four children.</P>

<P><b>3. Michael Robbins</b> was born about 1810 in Randolph County, North Carolina.&nbsp; He
moved to Harlan County in about 1840.&nbsp;&nbsp; He married Elisabeth A. Crawford daughter
of John Crawford Sr.&nbsp; Michael and Elizabeth were living in Knox County in
1850.&nbsp; Michael was listed as William M. Robins on the 1860 census of
Harlan County.&nbsp; In 1870 they were in Josh Bell County, and he was listed as
Michael.&nbsp; In 1880 they
were in Bell County and Michael was listed as William Robbins.&nbsp; I am not
sure if his name was William Michael or Michael William.&nbsp; He died about 1896.&nbsp;</P>

<P><b>4. Absalom Robbins</b>   -- according to the <i> History of Bell County, KY</i> by Henry H.
Tuson, Absalom Robbins. was born about 1812 in Randolph County, North Carolina.&nbsp;
Mr. Tuson also said that Absalom Robbins came to Kentucky from North Carolina in
about 1856.&nbsp;I believe the Absalom Robbins who appeared in Clay County on
the 1860 census living with Mary (Masagee) Robbins was probably her son.&nbsp;
His age was listed as 23 on the 1860, but he was 45 on the 1870 and 54 on the
1880.&nbsp; Absalom and his wife Nancy and their family were living in Webster
County, Missouri in 1880.&nbsp; If the Absalom listed in the 1860 Clay County 
census was the son of
Jonathan and Mary than the age listed for him in the History of Bell County, KY
was off by several years.&nbsp; He was probably born about 1826 and that would
make him the baby of the family rather than Jacob Alexander.</P>

<P><b>5.<a href="LinkMaryRobbinsHolt.htm"> Mary Robbins</a> </b> was born about 1814 in Randolph County, North Carolina. She married Nathaniel Holt about 1835/36
in Buncombe County,&nbsp; North Carolina. They were living in Clay County, KY in
1850, and in Jackson County in 1860, 1870 and 1880.</P>

<P><b>6. Nellie Robbins</b> was born about 1816 in Randolph County, North Carolina. She died about 1832 in
Buncombe County, N.C.</P>

<P><b>7. Jane Robbins</b> was born about 1818 in Randolph County, North Carolina. She married Thomas Runions
in August, 1839 in Yancey County .&nbsp; They were in Yancey County in
1840.&nbsp; I haven't found them in 1850, but they were listed on the census of Cherokee County, North Carolina in 1860, 1870 and 1880.&nbsp;
Jane was listed as Martha Jane on the 1880 census.</P>

<P><b>8. <a href="LinkAddisonBall.htm"> Abigail Robbins</a> </b> was born about 1820 in
Randolph County, North Carolina.&nbsp; She
married Addison Ball in August 1839 in Yancey County.&nbsp; They appeared in the
1840 Yancey Census. By 1850 they were living in Clay County, KY. Addison Ball (listed incorrectly as Baugh on the
1850 census) was born about 1821 in North Carolina.  (CW deposition)&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P><b>9. Joshua Robbins</b> was born about 1822 in Randolph County, North Carolina. He married Hannah
Commons in North Carolina. 
According to the <i> History of Bell County</i>. Joshua was in KY a short time and returned to

Buncombe County at the home of Matilda's brother, William Goldsmith.&nbsp; In
1850 they were living in Clay County, KY.&nbsp; Jacob Alexander Robbins served
as a Private in Co. A, of the 47 KY Infantry Volunteers.&nbsp; According to his
Civil War pension papers, Jacob Alexander Robbins died 26 April 1867 at his home in Jackson County.</P>
