<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Godfrey M. Isaacs</b></font></p>
<p>Godfrey M. Isaacs was the son of John Isaacs and Isabella Moore.&nbsp; He was
born 16 February 1842 in Madison County.&nbsp; He enlisted in the Union Army on
19 August 1861 at Booneville, KY and served in Company D., 7th KY
Volunteer Infantry.&nbsp; Godfrey was discharged 12 October 1864 at
Indianapolis, Indiana.&nbsp; He married Elizabeth A. Rider in Indianapolis,
Indiana, right after the war and brought her back to Jackson County to
live.&nbsp; According to the CW deposition of his sister Deborah, Godfrey and
Elizabeth moved in with his parents when he first got back from the war.&nbsp;
Godfrey and Elizabeth left Kentucky in about 1877 and moved to Illinois.&nbsp; They
were in Wayne County, Illinois in 1880, living next door to Godfrey's sister
Deborah and her husband Andrew Isaacs, the son of Isaac Isaacs and Susannah
Huff.&nbsp; From Illinois they moved to
Missouri.&nbsp; Godfrey's wife Elizabeth died 17 June 1882 in Texas County,
Missouri of complications of childbirth 3 days after giving birth to daughter
Elisabeth Anne.&nbsp; Godfrey remarried 22 September 1883 to Sarah A. Smith,
daughter of James O. Smith.&nbsp; Godfrey died
in January, 1911 while living in Bernie, Stoddard, Missouri.&nbsp;His wife Sarah
married James M. Foster 18 November, 1911.&nbsp; Sarah died 2 February 1940 at
McDougal, Clay County, Arkansas.</p>

Isaacs and his wives Elizabeth Rider and Sarah Smith.&nbsp; Her information came

In the claim of Sarah E. Isaacs widow of Godfrey M. Isaacs late of Co. D, 7th
Reg't., Ky Inf. Vol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On this 31 day of May, 1911, before me a County Court clerk in and for the
aforesaid County duly authorized to administer oats, personally appeared Sally
A. Isaacs, aged 70 years, whose Post Office address is Foxtown, State of
Kentucky, well known to me to be respectable and entitled to credit, and who,
being duly sworn, declare in relation to aforesaid case as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was well acquainted with the soldier, Godfrey M. Isaacs, from the time he was
a very small boy until the Civil War and for several years afterward.&nbsp; He
lived about 6 miles from my home and I was often in his company.&nbsp; He was
married to Elizabeth A. Rider just after he was mustered out of Army and he was
never married previous to said marriage; I was not present at his marriage, but
he said he was married to Elizabeth A., Rider in Indiana.&nbsp; I don't know the
County.&nbsp; I think I would have known it if he had been previously married,
as I was reared up in his immediate neighborhood with him and was often with
him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sally
A. Isaacs&nbsp;&nbsp; [I think this is Sarah A. Lakes who married John Isaacs,
the brother of Godfrey]</p>

said minor children of her former husband Godfrey M. Isaacs, namely Rebekah F.
