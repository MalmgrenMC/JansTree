<p>Godfrey M. Isaacs was the son of John Isaacs and Isabella Moore.&nbsp; He was
born 16 February 1842 in Madison County.&nbsp; He enlisted in the Union Army on
19 August 1861 at Booneville, KY and served in Company D., 7th KY
Volunteer Infantry.&nbsp; Godfrey was discharged 12 October 1864 at
Indianapolis, Indiana.&nbsp; He married Elizabeth A. Rider in Indianapolis,
Indiana, right after the war and brought her back to Jackson County to
live.&nbsp; According to the CW deposition of his sister Deborah, Godfrey and
Elizabeth moved in with his parents when he first got back from the war.&nbsp;
Godfrey and Elizabeth left Kentucky in about 1877 and moved to Illinois.&nbsp; They
were in Wayne County, Illinois in 1880, living next door to Godfrey's sister
Deborah and her husband Andrew Isaacs, the son of Isaac Isaacs and Susannah
Huff.&nbsp; From Illinois they moved to
Missouri.&nbsp; Godfrey's wife Elizabeth died 17 June 1882 in Texas County,
Missouri of complications of childbirth 3 days after giving birth to daughter
Elisabeth Anne.&nbsp; Godfrey remarried 22 September 1883 to Sarah A. Smith,
daughter of James O. Smith.&nbsp; Godfrey died
in January, 1911 while living in Bernie, Stoddard, Missouri.&nbsp;His wife Sarah
married James M. Foster 18 November, 1911.&nbsp; Sarah died 2 February 1940 at
McDougal, Clay County, Arkansas.</p>

Isaacs and his wives Elizabeth Rider and Sarah Smith.&nbsp; Her information came
from Godfrey M. Isaacs' family bible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
