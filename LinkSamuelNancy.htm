<p ALIGN="center"><b> <font size="5"> Samuel Isaacs and Nancy Baldridge</font></b></p>
<p ALIGN="left">Samuel Isaacs was born about 1773, probably in North Carolina.&nbsp;He
was the son of <a href="LinkGodfreySr.htm"> Godfrey Isaacs</a>.&nbsp; He married Nancy Baldridge about 1790, most likely in North Carolina, since their sons Godfrey
and William, both listed North Carolina as their birthplace on various censuses. Nancy Baldridge was born about 1773 in North
Carolina.&nbsp; She was the daughter of William Baldridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Samuel and Nancy were living in Russell County,
Virginia prior to moving to Floyd County, Kentucky.&nbsp; Samuel first appeared
on the Russell County Tax records in 1797, along with his brother,
Godfrey.&nbsp; We assume Samuel and Nancy were in
Floyd by 1812, because their son, Godfrey, married in Floyd County in 1812, and
Samuel gave his consent.&nbsp; Samuel and Nancy sold their land in Russell
County in 1812, and the deed was recorded in 1813.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left">Russell County Deed Book No. 4, Page 543<br>
<br>
May 20, 1812&nbsp; [Grant Deed from Samuel and Nancy Isaacks to Andrew Long]<br>
<br>
This Indenture made this twentieth day of May one-thousand-eight-hundred and twelve between Samuel Isaacks and Nancy his wife of the County of Floyd and
State of Kentucky of the one part and Andrew Long of the County of Russell and the State of Virginia  of the other part, __that for and in
consideration of the sum of two-hundred and fifty dollars to them...they doth acknowledge do bargain and sell unto the said Andrew Long  and his
heirs a certain tract or parcel of land lying and being in the County of Russell on the north side of the north fork of Cars Creek, a part of the
waters of Mockensin Creek and borders as follows, to wit beginning at a white oak and a red oak ... Containing thirty-one acres.<br>

                        Proved and Recorded                January 5, 1813<br>

          James P. Cassell,   D.C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left">According to Barry Isaacs, the North Fork of Carr Creek is along VA 699 and VA
673,  east of U.S. Highway Alt. 58 between Hansenville and Dickensonville, 
(Virginia), approximately 15 miles north of Bristol, Tennessee.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Samuel Isaacs and his brother Godfrey were both listed in the
1820 Clay County census.&nbsp; They also appeared on the Clay County tax list
that same year.&nbsp; Both were listed as over 21 but neither owned any land or
had a horse, so their total tax value was zero.&nbsp; Godfrey continued to
appear on the Clay County tax list, but Samuel was not listed from 1821 to
1824.&nbsp; Perry County was formed in 1821 and Samuel Isaacs Sr. was listed in
the first Perry County tax list.&nbsp; Samuel reappeared on the Clay County tax
list in 1825 with one horse with a taxable value of $50.00</p>
<p ALIGN="left"> On the 1st Saturday in August, 1826 Samuel and Nancy Isaacs
were received into the Elk Lick Baptist Church &quot;by letter.&quot;&nbsp; (To
be received &quot;by letter&quot; indicates that they had previously been a
member of another Baptist congregation.) &nbsp; At that time the
Elk Lick Baptist Church was located in Clay County. The same month that Samuel
and Nancy joined the Elk Lick Baptist Church, another Samuel Isaacs was received
&quot;by recantation.&quot;&nbsp; The 2nd Samuel was most likely Samuel and
Nancy's son Samuel.&nbsp; There are several references to Samuel Isaacs in the
minutes of the Elk Lick Church, some make reference to committee work and I
would guess that those involved the senior Samuel.&nbsp; There are also a fair
amount of references to disobedience, and I would imagine that those concern the
younger Samuel, especially since the senior Samuel died in about 1828, but the
references to ill behavior continue long after that.&nbsp; Some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">June, 1826:&nbsp;&nbsp; The church required Samuel Isaacs to
  come forward and let them know why he had blasphemed the name of God. The
  church getting no satisfaction after due labors, excluded him for the church.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">February 1827:&nbsp; Brother Reynolds laid a report against
  Sam Isaacs saying, &quot;he had been drinking too much spirituous liquor and
  using profane language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">July 1828:&nbsp; S. Isaacs received by recantation.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">March 1832: The church takes up the matter concerning Brother
  Samuel Isaacs from last meeting &quot;laid in by Brother Reynolds. Brother
  Moore &quot;says that Brother Isaacs told him that he had acted wickedly and
  wishes the church to wait with him.&quot;&nbsp; The church concludes to
  &quot;exclude Brother Samuel Isaacs from her fellowship.&quot;</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">July 1837:&nbsp; Samuel Isaac came forward and &quot;let the
  church know he had acted in disorder.&quot; The church took up the matter and
  &quot;say they are satisfied with the brother's acknowledgment.&quot;</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">April 1839: Samuel Isaacs let the church know he had
  &quot;done wrong pertaining to his family.&nbsp; The church took up the matter
  and laid it over to the next meeting.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left">In 1828 Samuel received a land grant for 100 acres in Clay
County.&nbsp; He was listed on the tax record that year with 100 acres on the
Sturgeon River and two horses.&nbsp; Samuel died in either late 1828 or early
1829.&nbsp; Samuel's name appeared on the 1829 tax record with the same 100
acres on the Sturgeon but only one horse.&nbsp; He was probably already deceased
when the tax was accessed, but if the estate hadn't been settled, Samuel's name
would still have appeared on the tax rolls. </p>
<p ALIGN="left"> Nancy Baldridge Isaacs appeared as head of the household on the 1830 census in Clay County.&nbsp;She
did not appear on the 1840 census.&nbsp; However, since the 1840 census only
listed heads of households, she could have been living with one of her children.&nbsp; She
was living with her daughter Polly Mays in Owsley in 1850 and with her
daughter Jane Agnes Gabbard in Owsley in 1860.&nbsp; I cannot find Nancy Isaacs on the
1870 census.&nbsp; She probably died
sometime between 1860 and 1870.&nbsp;Samuel Isaacs is buried in &quot;The Samuel 
Isaacs Cemetery,&quot; on small ridge just east of KY 399 approximately one mile 
north of Vincent in Owsley County.&nbsp; The cemetery is at the very upper end of the 
Duck Fork watershed. The Isaacs home site was north of the cemetery (also east 
of KY 399), across a small hollow from the cemetery. Nancy is buried with 
husband Samuel in &quot;The Samuel Isaacs Cemetery.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I probably don't have a complete list of the children of Samuel
and Nancy.&nbsp; They might have left married children in Virginia when they 
came to Kentucky.&nbsp; It is
also possible that I might have contributed a child to them who doesn't
belong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="center"><b><font size="4">Children of Samuel Isaacs and Nancy Baldridge</font></b></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><b>1. <a href="LinkGodfreyKeziah.htm"> Godfrey Isaacs</a> </b> born about
1793 in North
Carolina.&nbsp; He married Keziah Johnson in Floyd County on the 20th of&nbsp; February, 1812.&nbsp;
Keziah Johnson was the daughter of Patrick Johnson and his wife Delila.</p>
<blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left">20 Feb 1812 Godfrey Isaach and Patrick Johnson
are bondsmen for the marriage of Godfrey Isaachs and Keziah Johnson.&nbsp; I
give my consent for my son to marry&nbsp; Keziah Johnson, 18 Feb 1812, Samuel
Isaachs.&nbsp; <i><font size="3">Annals of Floyd County, Kentucky </font>p.132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Godfrey
and Keziah, and three of their children died in September 1863 of typhoid.</p>
<p><b>2. <a href="LinkWmIsaacs.htm"> William B. Isaacs</a>  </b> was born about 1794 in North Carolina.&nbsp; He married
Sarah Johnson on 7 August 1813 in Floyd County.&nbsp; She was the daughter of
John Johnson and Caty Reynolds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7 Aug 1813 William Isaach and Amose Stone are
bondsmen for the marriage of William Isaac and Mary Johnson. I give my consent
for the marriage of William Isaac and Sarah Johnson – John Johnson.&nbsp; <i><font size="3">Annals of Floyd County, Kentucky
</font>p.136&nbsp;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has been some confusion because the names Mary Johnson and Sarah
Johnson are both named in the bond.&nbsp; However, the name Sarah is used consistently
on the census entries.&nbsp; Sarah died 11 March 1875 in Floyd County and William died 6 June1876 in
Floyd County.</p>
<p><b>3.<a href="LinkSamuelIsaacsJr.htm"> Samuel Isaacs</a> </b> was born about 1795 in North Carolina.&nbsp; I assume he married
prior to 1824 when his son George W. Isaacs was born.&nbsp; I haven't been able
to find a record of this marriage.&nbsp; An 1858
Jackson County land record lists Samuel and his wife Sarah selling a piece of
land to their son Andrew.&nbsp; Sarah's maiden name remains a mystery. There are
a lot of unknowns concerning Samuel and his family, thus the nickname, &quot;Mystery
Sam.&quot;&nbsp; The death of a Samuel Isaacs was listed in <i>Rockcastle County
Death Records,</i>&nbsp;&quot;Samuel Isaacs died August 1859, age 65 of fever, sick
for 35 days.&quot;&nbsp; A Sarah Isaacs, age 65, appeared on the 1860 Rockcastle census with
the family of Godfrey Isaacs and Malinda Wilder.&nbsp; Since this Godfrey was the
son of &quot;Mystery Sam&quot; it seems likely that this was his mother, and that
the death record was for his father, Samuel.</p>
<p><b>4.<a href="LinkElizabethIsaacsHerodJohnson.htm"> Elizabeth Isaacs</a> </b> was born about
1803 in Virginia.&nbsp; She
married Herod Johnson 24 November 1820 in Floyd County.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Herrad Johnson and Elisha Isaacs are
bondsmen for the marriage of&nbsp; Herrad Johnson and Elizabeth Isaacs. I am willing
that Herrad Johnson marry my daughter Betsy Isaacs – Samuel Isaaacs.&nbsp; <i><font size="3">Annals of Floyd
County, Kentucky </font>p.259</i></p>
<p>Betsy Isaacs to Herrad Johnson 24 November 1820 - Marriage Return</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure who the bondsman, Elisha Isaacs is.&nbsp; Elizabeth's brother Elisha would only be about 12 years old in 1820, and
probably too young to serve in such a capacity.</p>
<p>Herod Johnson most likely died in Floyd County prior to 1840 as Elizabeth Johnson
was listed as the head of the household on the Madison County 1840 census.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 1850 census, Elizabeth Isaacs Johnson was listed as Elizabeth Tillery,
the wife of&nbsp; Isaac Tillery.&nbsp; The census stated they were married
during the census year.&nbsp; I haven't found a record of the marriage, although
it seems likely they were married in Madison County. Isaac Tillery's death was listed in the Madison County Vital Records, &quot;Isaac Tillery 70 years old,
cooper, resided at Indian Creek, Madison County, born in North Carolina, died
February 1852, pleurisy.&quot;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Isaacs Johnson Tillery appeared on the 1860, 1870 and 1880 censuses
of Jackson County.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. <a href="LinkJamesIsaacsSr.htm"> James Isaacs</a> </b> was born about 1804 in Virginia.&nbsp; He was first
married in Perry County.&nbsp; Since the records
that exist only mention the name of the groom, we do not know the name of James'
first wife.&nbsp; The record we have states, &quot;21 August 1823 – James
Isaacs married by John Morris&quot;</p>
<p>James married a 2nd time on 22 August 1847 in Madison County to Mrs. Elizabeth
Davis, a widow.&nbsp;James already had a large family when he married Elizabeth,
who had a large family of her own. However the Laurel County court record
indicate that Elizabeth Davis left most of her children with
friends and family in Laurel County.&nbsp; The 1850 census taker made it difficult
to figure out who belonged to whom when he listed all the children from both marriages as
Isaacs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the problem was cleared up with the 1860 census, but
questions still remain.</p>
<p>James died sometime before June of 1862&nbsp; in Jackson County.&nbsp; His heirs were
listed
several times in various land records.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6. <a href="LinkElijahIsaacs.htm"> Elijah Isaacs</a> </b> was born about 1808 in Virginia.&nbsp; He married
Sally Bowman 15 April 1830 in Clay County.&nbsp;&nbsp;He appeared in the 1830
census of Clay County, but I can't find him on the 1840 census.&nbsp; He
appeared
in Owsley County on the 1850 through 1880 censuses.</p>
<p><b>7. <a href="LinkJaneAgnessIsaacs.htm"> Jane Agnes </a> </b> or Agnes Jane Isaacs was born 24 December
1811, in Russell County, Virginia.&nbsp; She married Isaac Hugh Gabbard on 27 Feb 1827.&nbsp;
A record of the marriage is listed in Clay County, but a note on the bond states
that the actual marriage took place in Estill County.*&nbsp; Isaac Hugh Gabbard was born 14 May 1805 in Washington County, Virginia, the son
of Henry Gabbard and Barbara Hunsucker.&nbsp; Nancy Baldridge
Isaacs was living with Isaac Hugh and Jane Agnes in 1860.&nbsp; The census
indicated that she was blind.&nbsp; According to their tombstones Isaac Hugh Gabbard died in 1892 and Jane Agnes
died 1 April 1896. Both are buried in Owsley County.</p>
<p>*a note from Barry:&nbsp; Samuel Isaacs' family was living on a strip of
land that is in present day Lee County, but on the Clay/Estill line in 1827.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>8.<a href="LinkRachelIsaacsHarrison.htm"> Rachel Isaacs</a>  </b> was born April 1813 in Floyd County.&nbsp; She married
George Harrison, the son of Elisha Harrison and Ipha/Effie Baker on 3 March 1831 in
Clay County.&nbsp; George was born about 1809 in Estill County.&nbsp; A bond for
the marriage of George Harrison and Rachel Isaacs was filed in Clay
County.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>George Harrison and Rachel Isaacs joined in holy marriage 3 March 1831&nbsp;
-- signed: E.W. Bowman, with Henry Gabbard as bondsman.</p>
<p>Mr. Abner Baker, sir:&nbsp; Pleas to let George Harrison have marriage lisons
for my daughter Rachel Isaacks and her father is dead, and you will much oblig
your friend, Nancy Isaacs, given under my hand this 2 March 1831 also signed by
Henry Gabbard and James Isaacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deaths of George Harrison and one of his daughters were recorded in the Madison County Vital
Records.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Died of flux in September
1852, George Harrison, 40 years old, male, farmer, resided in Clover
Bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daughter Harrison, no age given, female, resided
in Clover Bottom, daughter of George Harrison, died September 1852 of Flux.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The
daughter who died might have been Iphy who was born about 1843.&nbsp; She
appeared on the 1850 but not on the 1860 census.&nbsp; I don't think Rachel ever remarried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rachel appeared on the 1880 and 1900 censuses of Jackson County.&nbsp; In
1900 she said she had nine children, five of whom were still living.&nbsp; She was
listed as 87 years old, and a widow.</p>
<p><b>9. <a href="LinkFieldingIsaacs.htm"> Fielding Isaacs</a> </b> was born about 1816 in Clay County.&nbsp; He married Susan
Bowman on the 1st of September, 1830 in Clay County.&nbsp; Susan Bowman was born about 1816 in Booneville,
Owsley County.&nbsp; Because both Fielding and Susan would have only been 14&nbsp;
in 1830, there has been some question about the accuracy of this date.&nbsp;In
her Civil War pension deposition of 13 November 1884, Susan said she was 18 when she married
Fielding.&nbsp; Even though this later date does not agree with the county's recorded
date, it does seem to coincide a little better with the birth of their first
child in 1835. </p>
<p>According to many of the depositions given on behalf of Susan Isaacs (she
claimed a mother's pension based on the service of her son Jasper, who died during
the Civil War), Fielding
was a womanizer who had had numerous affairs before he deserted his family about
1861.&nbsp; Fielding and Susan's divorce was granted in November of 1867, and became
effective one year later.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
1870, Fielding was living in Garrard County with an 18 year old girl named Jennie
Johnson.&nbsp; In 1880 he was living with the same Jennie in Wayne County.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>10. Nancy Isaacs</b> was born about 1817 in Clay County.&nbsp; She married Hardin
Sloan about 1838.&nbsp; Hardin was born about 1812 and died before 1865:</p>
<p>Jackson County Land Records, Book 1 Pg. 441</p>
<p>9 Jan 1865&nbsp; Heirs of James Isaacs on the first part and Nancy Sloan and
heirs of Hardin Slone on the 2<sup>nd</sup> part, in consideration of $100.00
paid to James Isaacs while he was still alive, Hardin Sloan bought a tract of
land on Birch Lick Waters of Indian Creek, 25 acres more or less, bounded by
James Isaacs land, embracing the boundary of land marked out by James Isaacs to
Hardin Sloan and the same now in possession of Nancy Sloan. Signed by: James R.
Isaacs, Lucinda Isaacs, Andrew Isaacs, Silas Isaacs, G.W. Isaacs, Jane Isaacs,
Mary Jane Isaacs, Fielden Isaacs, William Riley Isaacs, Isaac Harrison, Harden
Isaacs, Emily Isaacs, Masiah Isaacs, Leuta Harrison, Louisa Isaacs. — I have
no interest in this land: JM Johnson &amp; Hezekiah Isaacs.</p>
<p>Nancy was in Jackson County in 1870, and in Madison County in 1880.</p>
<p><b>11. Polly Isaacs </b> was born about 1818 in Clay County.&nbsp; She married Giles
May 12 November 1838 in Clay County.&nbsp; The consent for her marriage was
signed by her mother who was a widow at the time.</p>
<p>11 November 1838: I do hereby certify that I, Nancy Isaacks of this county of
Clay and State of Kentucky Doth this day agree that Polly Isaacks, my daughter
shall be permitted to marry Giles Mays this acknowledgment is made in the
presents of Patrick Hamilton and Fealdon Isaacks. This is therefore to authorize
you to licen and permit you then (?) for the same. Atest: Patr Hamilton &amp;
Fealdon Iaacks.</p>
<p> Nancy Baldridge Isaacs, was living with her daughter Polly in Owsley County in 1850.&nbsp;
Polly Isaacs Mays appeared in Owsley County on the 1860, 1870
and 1880 censuses.</p>
