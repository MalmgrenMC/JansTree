      </b>Sampler found in old caravan in the garden to the right of&nbsp; the
      cottage at Terriers End, and sent to Janice Allen Faulconer in 1964 by
      Mrs. E.M. Dixon, who lived at Terriers End at the time.&nbsp; Mrs. Dixon
      had been told that Lydia Allen Clark, daughter of William and Eliza, had
      moved back to Terriers End and lived in the caravan during her later
      years.&nbsp; Perhaps the sampler was Lydia's work.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></p>
