      Picture #48 in album: Nothing on the back. But I believe this is a picture
      of William Allen who was born about 1817/1818, and died from a fall from a
      hay wagon 7 July 1873.&nbsp; His death was listed in the church records of
      Drayton Beauchamp, (Buckingham).&nbsp; This picture might have been taken of William after
      his death.
