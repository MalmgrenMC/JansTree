      <i>Picture #21 in album:</i>  The back is blank. My grandfather, Ernest
      Allen, told me that this picture and
      #22 were &quot;old maid aunts&quot; of his father. Because of the similarities,
      it is most likely that #21and #22 were taken at the Sam Glen Payne studio
      in Aylesbury.</FONT></p>
